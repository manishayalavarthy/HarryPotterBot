p45
ag45
aS'It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors,'
p46
aS'Look at Snape!'
p47

p107
aS"I'd like to see Black try and break into Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Anyway, Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn't they? They live over the shop!"
p108
aS'Like trying to go after Black,'
p109
aS"D'you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?"
p110
aS"I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you'd heard your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn't forget it in\n"
p111
aS"You're going to take Malfoy's advice instead of ours?"
p112
aS"Listen... you know what Pettigrew's mother got back after Black had finished with him? Dad told me -- the Order of Merlin, First Class, and Pettigrew's finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him they could find. Black's a madman, Harry, and he's dangerous --"
p113
aS'Say You-Know-Who, will you?'
p114
aS"Think we'd better go and get someone?"
p115

p117
aS"It's what my mum does whenever someone's upset,"
p118
aS'Oy! Presents!'
p119
aS'Who sent it to you?'
p120
aS"That's why he wouldn't say it was from him!"
p121
aS'In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry'
p122
aS"Malfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He'll be sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!"
p123
aS"I can't believe this,"
p124
aS'Who -?'
p125
aS"Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together,"
p126
aS'Who cares?'
p127
aS'Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I?'
p128
aS'GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!'
p129
aS"You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione,"
p130
aS"Can't you shut that thing up?"
p131
aS"Still looks ill, doesn't he?"
p132
aS'And what are you tutting at us for?'
p133
aS"How's she doing it?"
p134
aS'Getting to all her classes!'
p135
aS'I heard her talking to\n'
p136
aS'Oh, shut up,'
p137
aS"I'll take it!"
p138
aS"I've got to give Scabbers his rat tonic."
p139

p140
aS"HE'S GONE! AND YOU KNOW\n"
p141
aS'He bit Goyle for us once!'
p142
aS'Remember, Harry?'
p143
aS'Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?'
p144
aS'Here you go,'
p145
aS'Lumos!'
p146
aS'Get out of here!'
p147
aS'See?'
p148
aS"She's still letting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now...."
p149
aS'Did you see his face?'
p150
aS"He can't believe it! This is brilliant!"
p151
aS"That's my boy!"
p152
aS'Yes!'
p153
aS'Yes! Yes!'
p154
aS'Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,'
p155
aS"Can't you give her a break?"
p156
aS'No,'
p157
aS"If she just acted like she was sorry -- but she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something."
p158
aS'Perce -- Sirius Black!'
p159
aS'In our dormitory! With a knife! Woke me up!'
p160
aS"IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE!"
p161
aS'PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS\n'
p162
aS"We know he's not coming in through Honeyduke's,"
p163
aS"We'd've heard if the shop had been broken into."
p164
aS'Why, though?'
p165
aS'Why did he run?'
p166
aS'Run for it, Neville,'
p167
aS'-- ate Scabbers!'
p168
aS"If she'd just get rid of that cat, I'd speak to her again!"
p169
aS"But she's still sticking up for it! It's a maniac, and she won't hear a word against it!"
p170
aS"So now you're trying to get Harry expelled!"
p171
aS"Haven't you done enough damage this year?"
p172
aS'So how about it?'
p173
aS"Come on, last time we went you didn't see anything. You haven't even been inside Zonko's yet!"
p174
aS"'Bye!"
p175
aS'See you when you get back!'
p176
aS'What kept you?'
p177
aS'Where are you?'
p178
aS'Are you still there? This feels weird....'
p179
aS'Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,'
p180
aS"I asked Nearly Headless Nick... he says he's heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut...."
p181
aS'Harry!'
p182
aS"you'd better run for it! If Malfoy tells anyone -- you'd better get back to the castle, quick --"
p183
aS'See you\n'
p184
aS'Ron gave them to me,'
p185
aS'He -brought them back from Hogsmeade last time --'
p186
aS"I don't want to hear explanations,"
p187
aS"I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it' s a map,"
p188
aS"I don't want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn't hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a\n"
p189
aS"It's my fault,"
p190
aS"I persuaded you to go. Lupin's right, it was stupid, we shouldn't've done it --"
p191
aS'Come to have a good gloat?'
p192
aS'Or have you just been to tell on us?'
p193
aS'Yeah, it will,'
p194
aS"You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help."
p195
aS"There's still the appeal!"
p196
aS"Don't give up Yet, we're working on it!"
p197
aS'Hermione!'
p198
aS'Hermione!'
p199
aS"She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too,"
p200
aS"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?"
p201
aS"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term,"
p202
aS"Well, honestly... 'the fates have informed her' who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!"
p203
aS'Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,'
p204
aS"I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes"
p205
aS'so as to clear the Inner\n'
p206
aS"I give up! I'm leaving!"
p207
aS"Some day Hermione's having, eh?"
p208

p210
aS"What're you or, about?"
p211
aS'Hermione?'
p212
aS"Er -- are you sure you've copied down these\n"
p213
aS"Does that mean the appeal's already happened?"
p214
aS"Why'd you stop me?"
p215
aS"Did you see them? They've even got the axe ready! This isn't justice!"
p216
aS'Nope,'
p217

p218
aS'Buckbeak lost,'
p219
aS"Hagrid's just sent this."
p220
aS"She hasn't gone to get it?"
p221
aS"Ron, I don't believe it -- it's Scabbers!"
p222
aS'Scabbers!'
p223
aS'Scabbers, what are you doing here?'
p224
aS"I'll let yeh out the back way,"
p225
aS"Scabbers, it's me, you idiot, it's Ron,"
p226
aS'Hagrid,'
p227
aS'Scabbers, keep still,'
p228
aS"What's the matter with you, You stupid rat? Stay still -- OUCH! He bit me!"
p229
aS'Not a dog,'
p230
aS"Harry, it's a trap --"
p231
aS'Did you hear me?'
p232
aS"You'll have to kill all three of us!"
p233
aS'Get out of the way!'
p234
aS'Get away ftom me, werewolf!'
p235
aS'One of us!'
p236
aS'What?'
p237
aS"What's my rat got to do with anything?"
p238
aS'Sirius, NO!'
p239
aS"WAIT! You can't do it just like that -- they need to understand -- we've got to explain --"
p240
aS"You're nutters, both of you,"
p241
aS"I've had enough of this. I'm off."
p242
aS"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!"
p243
ag243
aS'Shh!'
p244
aS"The joke's on you again, Severus,"
p245
aS'As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle'
p246
aS"I'll\n"
p247
aS'What about it?'
p248
aS"He's got a toe missing,"
p249
aS'What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?'
p250
aS'Ready, Sirius?'
p251
aS'There!'
p252
aS"Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry's head! Why should I?"
p253
aS'I let you sleep in my bed!'
p254
aS'Kind boy... kind master...'
p255

p258
aS'Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the tree -- and so did you -- this is weird--'
p259
aS"That's wonderful!"
p260
aS"I'm going to see him,"
p261
aS'What?'
p262
aS'Read it aloud!'
p263
aS'What do you reckon?'
p264
aS'Definitely an owl?'
p265
aS"That's good enough for me,"
p266
aS"He's mine."
p267
aS"I'll call about the World Cup!"
p268
aS'Shut up,'
p269
aS'Are you really Harry Potter?'
p270
aS"So that's where You-Know-Who\n"
p271
aS'Nothing?'
p272
aS'Are all your family wizards?'
p273
ag273
aS'What?'
p274
aS"She always forgets I don't like corned beef."
p275
aS"Do they? What, they don't move at all?"
p276
aS'weird!'
p277
aS'You want to be careful with those,'
p278
aS'When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger- flavored one once.'
p279
aS"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,"
p280
aS"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look..."
p281
aS"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then."
p282
aS"I'm Ron Weasley,"

aS"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the\n"
p287
aS'Say that again,'
p288
aS'What has been going on?'
p289
aS"I've heard of his family,"
p290
aS"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side."
p291
aS'Can we help you with something?'
p292
aS"No more'n four to a boat!"
p293
aS"So we've just got to try on the hat!"
p294

p295
aS'GRYFFINDOR!'

p298
aS" Great food, isn't it?"
p299
aS"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets."
p300
aS'What have we got today?'
p301
aS'Make yerselves at home,'
p302
aS'that old git.'
p303
aS"What is a wizard's duel?"
p304
aS"And what do you mean, you're my second?"
p305
aS"Well, a second's there to take over if you die,"
p306
aS'Throw it away and punch him on the nose,'
p307
aS'Excuse me.'
p308
aS"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --"
p309
aS'Bet you could,'
p310
aS"If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them."
p311
aS'Half-past eleven,'
p312
aS"we'd better go."
p313
aS'You!'
p314
aS'Go back to bed!'
p315
aS"You've got some nerve --"
p316
aS"He's late, maybe he's chickened out,"
p317
aS'This way!'
p318
aS'This is it!'
p319
aS"We're done for! This is the end!"
p320
aS"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?"
p321
aS'If any dog needs exercise, that one does.'
p322
aS"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,"
p323
ag323
aS'A Nimbus Two Thousand!'
p324
aS"I've never even touched one."
p325
aS"It's not any old broomstick,"
p326
aS"it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?"
p327
aS"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same\n"
p328
aS'Not arguing, I hope, boys?'
p329
aS"Well, it's true,"
p330
aS"If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...."
p331
aS'Wow,'
p332
aS"You do it, then, if you're so clever,"
p333
aS"It's no wonder no one can stand her,"
p334
aS"she's a nightmare, honestly. "
p335
aS"She doesn't know about the troll."
p336
aS"He's heading for the third floor,"
p337
aS'The keys in the lock,'
p338
aS'We could lock it in.'
p339
aS'Good idea,'
p340
aS'Oy, pea-brain!'
p341
aS'Wingardium Leviosa!'
p342
aS"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived."
p343
aS'We should have gotten more than ten points,'
p344
aS"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's."
p345
aS'Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,'
p346
aS'Mind you, we did save her.'
p347
aS"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,"
p348
aS'Did you get it?'
p349
aS"What's the matter?"
p350
aS"But this isn't soccer, Dean,"
p351
aS'Come on, Hermione,'
p352
aS'Neville, you can look!'
p353
aS"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,"
p354
aS'It was Snape,'
p355
aS"Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."
p356
aS'Hi, Hagrid, want any help?'
p357
aS'Merry Christmas,'
p358
aS'You can keep it,'
p359

p369
aS'See?'
p370
aS"The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"
p371
aS"I'm going to play,"
p372
aS"If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win."
p373
aS"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,"
p374

p375
aS"Don't nag."

p827
ag11
aS"But he's not dead, he's fine, so what's the point\n"
p828
aS"Molly, they say Sirius Black's mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban, and that's supposed to be impossible. It's been three weeks, and no one's seen hide nor hair of him, and I don't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is what Black's after\n"
p829
aS'But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.'
p830
aS'We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.'
p831
aS"But no one's really sure that Black's after Harry\n"
p832
aS"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn't report it in\n"
p833
aS"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you're\n"
p834
aS"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn't happy about it, but he agreed."

aS'Right then,'

p859
aS"I Don't go looking for trouble,"
p860
aS'Trouble usually finds me.'
p861
aS"It's coming from your trunk, Harry,"
p862
aS'Is that a Sneakoscope?'
p863
aS'Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?'
p864
aS"No! Well... I wasn't supposed to be using Errol. You know he's not really up to long journeys... but how else was I supposed to get Harry's present to him?"
p865
aS'We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,'
p866
aS'They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff. Fred and George told me.'
p867
aS'Do you know much about Hogsmeade?'
p868
aS"I've read it's the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain --"
p869
aS"But that's not Why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honey Dukes."
p870
aS"What's that?"
p871
aS"It's this sweetshop,"
p872
aS"where they've got everything... Pepper Imps -- they make you smoke at the mouth -- and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in class and just look like you're thinking what to write next --"
p873
aS"But Hogsmeade's a very interesting place, isn't it?"
p874
aS'In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shades supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain --'

p876
aS"Won't it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?"
p877
aS"What d'you mean?"

aS"Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face) -- and you -- you\n"
p923
aS'I thought you were having a fit or something,'
p924
aS'You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching -- 11\n'
p925
aS'And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,'
p926
aS"and he said, 'None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.' But the dementor didn't move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away.... "

aS'It was horrible,'
p928
aS'Did YOU feel how cold it got when it came in?'

p948
aS"Of course you're not,"
p949

aS'Bed rest? Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?'
p951
aS"I'm fine!"
p952
aS'Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least,'
p953
aS"I've already had some,"
p954
aS'Professor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us.'
p955
aS'Did he, now?'
p956
aS"So we've finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?"
p957
aS'Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?'
p958
aS'Yes, '
p959
aS'Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast together.'

p967
aS'and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises -- or even Invisibility Cloaks,'

p987
aS'Malfoy,'
p988
aS'That little git,'
p989
aS"He wasn't so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train. Came runing into our compartment, didn't he, Fred?"

aS'Nearly wet himself,'
p991
aS"I wasn't too happy myself,"
p992
aS"They're horrible things, those dementors...."

p994
aS'Forget it, Harry,'
p995
aS"Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he'd ever been, he came back all weak and shaking.... They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there."

aS'beware a red-haired man.'
p1022
aS'In the second term,'
p1023
aS'we shall progress to the crystal ball -- if we have finished with fire omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever.'
p1024
aS'I wonder, dear,'
p1025
aS'if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?'
p1026

aS"I don't think it looks like a Grim,"
p1051
aS"You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the\n"
p1052
aS' Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side.\n'
p1053
aS'It looks like a Grim if you do this,'
p1054
aS'but it looks more like a donkey from here,'
p1055
aS"When you've all finished deciding whether I'm going to die Or not!"
p1056
aS'I think we will leave the lesson here for today,'
p1057
aS'Yes... please pack away your things....'
p1058
aS'Until we meet again,'
p1059
aS'fair fortune be yours. Oh, and dear'
p1060
aS"you'll be late next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up."
p1061
aS'Really, what has got into you all today?'
p1062
aS"Not that it matters, but that's the first time my transformation's not got applause from a class."
p1063
aS"Please, Professor, we've just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and --"
p1064
aS'Ah, of course,'
p1065
aS'There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this year?'
p1066
aS'Me,'
p1067
aS'Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney --'
p1068
aS"You look in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don't let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in."
p1069
aS'Ron, cheer up,'
p1070
aS'You heard what Professor McGonagall said.'
p1071
aS'Harry,'
p1072
aS"You haven't seen a great black dog anywhere, have you?"
p1073
aS'Probably a stray,'
p1074
aS"Hermione, if Harry's seen a Grim, that's -- that's bad,"
p1075
aS'My\n'
p1076
ag11
aS'Coincidence,'
p1077
aS"You don't know what you're talking about!"
p1078
aS'Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!'
p1079
aS'There you are, then,'
p1080
aS"They see the Grim and die of fright. The Grim's not an omen, it's the cause of death! And Harry's still with us because he's not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I'd better kick the bucket then!"
p1081
aS'I think Divination seems very woolly,'
p1082
aS'A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.'
p1083
aS' said Hermione coolly.\n'
p1084
aS"Professor Trelawney said you didn't have the right aura! You just don't like being bad at something for a change!"
p1085
aS"If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I'm not sure I'll be studying it much longer! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!"
p1086
aS"What's she talking about?"
p1087
aS"She hasn't been to an Arithmancy class yet."
p1088
aS"C'mon, now, get a move on!"
p1089
aS"Got a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin' up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!"
p1090
aS"Everyone gather 'round the fence here!"
p1091
aS"That's it -- make sure yeh can see -- now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer books --"
p1092
aS'How?'
p1093
aS'Eh?'
p1094
aS'How do we open our books?'
p1095
aS"Hasn' -- hasn' anyone bin able ter open their books?"
p1096
aS"Yeh've got ter stroke 'em,"
p1097
aS'Look --'
p1098
aS"Oh, how silly we've all been!"
p1099
aS"We should have stroked them! why didn't we guess!"
p1100
aS'I -- I thought they were funny,'
p1101
aS'Oh, tremendously funny!'
p1102
aS'Really witty, giving us books that try and rip our hands off!'
p1103
aS"Righ' then,"
p1104
aS"so -- so yeh've got yer books an' -- an' - - now yeh need the Magical Creatures. Yeah. So I'll go an' get 'em. Hang on... "
p1105
aS'God, this place is going to the dogs,'
p1106
aS"That oaf teaching classes, my father'll have a fit when I tell him\n"
p1107
aS"Careful, Potter, there's a dementor behind you\n"
p1108
aS'Oooooooh!'
p1109
aS'Gee up, there!'
p1110
aS'Hippogriffs!'
p1111
aS"Beau'iful, aren' they?"
p1112
aS'So,'
p1113
aS"if yeh wan' ter come a bit nearer --"
p1114
aS"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is, they're proud,"
p1115
aS"Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing yeh do."
p1116
aS"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs' move,"
p1117
aS"It's polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an' yeh wait. If he bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. If he doesn' bow, then get away from him sharpish, 'cause those talons hurt.\n"
p1118
aS'Right -- who wants ter go first?'
p1119
aS'No one?'
p1120
aS"I'll do it,"
p1121
aS'Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!'
p1122
aS'Good man, Harry!'
p1123
aS"Right then -- let's see how yeh get on with Buckbeak."
p1124
aS'Easy) now, Harry,'
p1125
aS"Yeh've got eye contact, now try not ter blink.... Hippogriffs don' trust yeh if yeh blink too\n"
p1126
ag11
aS'Ah,'
p1127
aS'Right -- back away, now, Harry, easy does it\n'
p1128
aS'Well done, Harry!'
p1129
aS'Right -- yeh can touch him! Pat his beak, go on!'
p1130
aS"Righ' then, Harry,"
p1131
aS"I reckon he might' let yeh ride him!"
p1132
aS"Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint,"
p1133
aS"an' mind yeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that...."
p1134
aS"Go on, then'"
p1135
aS'Good work, Harry!'
p1136
aS'Okay, who else wants a go?'
p1137
aS"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.... I bet you're not dangerous at all, are you?"
p1138
aS'Are you, you great ugly brute?'
p1139
aS"I'm dying!"
p1140
aS"I'm dying, look at me! It's killed me!"
p1141
aS"Yer not dyin'!"
p1142
aS'Someone help me -- gotta get him outta here --'
p1143
aS'They should fire him straight away!'
p1144
aS"It was Malfoy's fault!"
p1145
aS"I'm going to see if he's okay!"
p1146
aS"You think he'll be all right?"
p1147
aS'Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,'
p1148
aS"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though, wasn't it?"
p1149
aS'Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him....'
p1150
aS"They wouldn't fire him, would they?"
p1151
aS"They'd better not,"
p1152
aS"If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It's still quite early..."
p1153
aS' Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him.\n'
p1154
aS"I'm allowed to walk across the grounds, "
p1155
aS"Sirius Black hasn't got past the dementors yet, has he?"
p1156
aS"C'min."
p1157
aS"'Spect it's a record,"
p1158
aS"Don' reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before."
p1159
aS"You haven't been fired, Hagrid!"
p1160
aS'Not yet,'
p1161
aS"But's only a matter o' time, i' n't it, after Malfoy..."
p1162
aS'Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,'
p1163
aS"but he's sayin' it's still agony... covered in bandages... moanin'..\n"
p1164
aS"School gov'nors have bin told, o' course,"
p1165
aS"They reckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later... done flobberworms or summat.... Jus' thought itdmake a good firs' lessons all my fault...."
p1166
aS"It's all Malfoy's fault, Hagrid!"
p1167
aS"We're witnesses,"
p1168
aS"You said hippogriffs attack if you insult them. It's Malfoy's problem that he wasn't listening. We'll tell Dumbledore what really happened."
p1169
aS"Yeah, don't worry, Hagrid, we'll back you up,"
p1170
aS"I think you've had enough to drink, Hagrid,"
p1171
aS'Stuck his head in the water barrel,'
p1172
aS"That's better,"
p1173
aS"Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an' see me, I really --\n"
p1174
aS"WHAT D'YEH THINK YOU'RE DOIN', EH?"
p1175
aS"YEH'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN' AROUND AFTER DARK,\n"
p1176
aS"C'mon!"
p1177
aS"I'm takin' yer all back up ter school, an' don' let me catch yeh walkin' down ter see me after dark again. I'm not worth that!"
p1178
aS'How is it, Draco?'
p1179
aS'Does it hurt much?'
p1180
aS'Settle down, settle down,'
p1181
aS'Sir,'
p1182
aS"sir, I'll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm --"
p1183
aS"There's nothing wrong with your arm,"
p1184
aS'Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.'
p1185
aS'Professor,'
p1186
aS"Weasley's mutilating my roots, sit."
p1187
aS'Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.'
p1188
aS'But, sit --!'
p1189
aS'Now,'
p1190
aS"And, sir, I'll need this shrivelfig skinned,"
p1191
aS'Seen your pal Hagrid lately?'
p1192
aS"I'm afraid he won't be a teacher much longer,"
p1193
aS"Father's not very happy about my injury --"
p1194
aS"Keep talking, Malfoy, and I'll give you a real injury,"
p1195
aS"- he's complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of Magic. Father's got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury like this"
p1196
aS"who knows if my arm'll ever\n"
p1197
ag11
aS"So that's why you're putting it on,"
p1198
aS'To try to get Hagrid fired.'
p1199
aS'Well,'
p1200
aS'partly, Potter. But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.'
p1201
aS'Orange, Longbottom,'
p1202
aS"Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one -tat spleen was needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?"
p1203
aS'Please, sir,'
p1204
aS'please, I could help Neville put it right --'
p1205
aS"I don't remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,"
p1206
aS'Longbottom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly.'
p1207
aS'Help me!'
p1208
aS'Hey, Harry,'
p1209
aS'have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning -- they reckon\n'
p1210
ag11
aS'Not too far from here,'
p1211
aS"It was a Muggle who saw him. 'Course, she didn't really understand. The Muggles think he's just an ordinary criminal, don't they? So she phoned the telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was gone."
p1212
aS'What, Malfoy? Need something else skinned?'
p1213
ag11
aS'Thinking Of trying to catch\n'
p1214
aS'Of course, if it was me,'
p1215
aS"I'd have done something before now. I wouldn't be staying in school like a good boy, I'd be out there looking for him."
p1216
aS"Don't you know, Potter?"
p1217
aS'Know what?'
p1218
aS"Maybe you'd rather not risk your neck,"
p1219
aS"Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I'd want revenge. I'd hunt him\n"
p1220
ag11
aS"Everyone gather 'round,"
p1221
ag11
aS'Five points from Gryffindor,'
p1222
aS'I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.'
p1223
aS'Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right!\n'
p1224
ag11
aS'She was right behind us,'
p1225
aS'There she is,'
p1226
aS'How did you do that?'
p1227
aS'What?'
p1228
aS'One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at the bottom of the stairs again.'
p1229
aS'What?'
p1230
aS'Oh -- I had to go back for something. Oh no --'
p1231
aS"You know how many subjects I'm taking,"
p1232
aS"Couldn't hold these for me, could you?"
p1233
aS'Oh yes,'
p1234
aS' she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.\n'
p1235
aS"D'you get the feeling Hermione's not telling us something?Ron asked Harry.\n"
p1236
aS'Good afternoon,'
p1237
aS"Would you please put all your books back in your bags. Today's will be a practical lesson. You will need only your wands."
p1238
aS'Right then,'
p1239
aS"If you'd follow me."
p1240
aS'Loony, loopy Lupin,'
p1241
aS'Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy Lupin --'
p1242
aS"I'd take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,"
p1243
aS"Mr. Filch won't be able to get in to his brooms."
p1244
aS'This is a useful little spell, he told the class over his shoulder. '
p1245
ag11
aS'Waddiwasi! '
p1246
aS'Cool, sit!'
p1247
aS'Thank you, Dean,'
p1248
aS'Shall we proceed?'
p1249
aS'Inside, please,'
p1250
aS"Leave it open, Lupin. I'd rather not witness this."
p1251
aS"Possibly no one's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear."
p1252
aS'I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,'
p1253
aS'and I am sure he will perform it admirably.'
p1254
aS'Now, then,'
p1255
aS'Nothing to worry about,'
p1256
aS"There's a boggart in there."
p1257
aS'Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,'
p1258
aS"Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I've even met one\n"
p1259
aS'So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?'
p1260
aS"It's a shape-shifter,"
p1261
aS'It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.'
p1262
aS"Couldn't have put it better myself,"
p1263
aS'So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.\n'
p1264
aS'This means,'
p1265
aS'that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?'
p1266
aS"Er -- because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it should be?"
p1267
aS'Precisely,'
p1268
aS"It's always best to have com pany when you're dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart make that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.\n"
p1269
aS'The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of\n'
p1270
aS'We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please ... Riddikulus!'
p1271
aS'Riddikulus!'
p1272
aS'Good,'
p1273
aS"Very good. But that was the easy part, I'm afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you come in, Neville."
p1274
aS'Right, Neville,'
p1275
aS'First things first: what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?'
p1276
aS"didn't catch that, Neville, sorry,"
p1277
aS'Professor Snape.'
p1278
aS'Professor Snape... hmmm... Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?'
p1279
aS'Er -- yes,'
p1280
aS"But -- I don't want the boggart to turn into her either."
p1281
aS'No, no, you misunderstand me,'
p1282
aS'I wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?'
p1283
aS'Well... always the same hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress... green, normally... and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.'
p1284
aS'And a handbag?'
p1285
aS'A big red one,'
p1286
aS'Right then,'
p1287
aS"Can you picture those clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind's eye?"
p1288
aS'Yes,'
p1289
aS'When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees You, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,'
p1290
aS"And You will raise your wand -- thus -- and cry 'Riddikulus' -- and concentrate hard on your grandmother's clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag."
p1291
aS'If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention\n'
p1292
aS' said Professor Lupin. '
p1293
ag11
aS'Everyone ready?'
p1294
aS"Neville, we're going to back away,"
p1295
aS"Let you have a clear field, all right? I'll call the next person forward.... Everyone\n"
p1296
ag11
aS'On the count of three, Neville,'
p1297
aS'One two -- three -- now!'
p1298
aS'R -- r -- riddikulus! '
p1299
aS'Parvati! Forward!'
p1300
aS'Riddikulus!'
p1301
aS'Seamus!'
p1302
aS' shouted\n'
p1303
aS' shouted Lupin. '
p1304
aS' Dean hurried forward.\n'
p1305
aS'Riddikulus!'
p1306
aS'Excellent! Ron, you next!'
p1307
aS'Riddikulus!'
p1308
aS'Here!'
p1309
aS'Riddikulus!'
p1310
aS'Forward, Neville, and finish him off!'
p1311
aS'Riddikulus!'
p1312
aS'Ha!'
p1313
aS'Excellent!'
p1314
aS'Excellent) Neville. Well done, everyone.... Let me See... five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart -- ten for Neville because he did it twice... and five each to Hermione and Harry.'
p1315
aS"But I didn't do anything,"
p1316
aS'You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class, Harry,'
p1317
aS'Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.'
p1318
aS'Did you see me take that banshee?'
p1319
aS'And the hand!'
p1320
aS'And Snape in that hat!'
p1321
aS'And my mummy!'
p1322
aS' said Lavender thoughtfully.\n'
p1323
aS'He seems like a very good teacher,'
p1324
aS'But I wish I could have had a turn with the boggart --'
p1325
aS'What would it have been for you?'
p1326
aS'A piece of homework that only got nine out of ten?'
p1327
aS'Look at the state of his robes,'
p1328
aS'He dresses like our old houseelf '
p1329
aS'Why would anyone bother looking after them?'
p1330
aS'This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup,'
p1331
aS"I'll be leaving at the end of this year. I'll never get another shot at it."
p1332
aS"Gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now. Okay, so we've had the worst luck in the world -- injuries -- then the tournamentgetting called off\n"
p1333
aS"But we also know we've got the best-ruddy-team-in-the-school,"
p1334
aS"We've got three superb Chasers."
p1335
aS"We've got two unbeatable Beaters."
p1336
aS"And we've got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!"
p1337
aS"We think you're very good too, Oliver,"
p1338
aS'Spanking good Keeper,'
p1339
aS'The point is,'
p1340
aS"the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the team, I've thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven't got it, and this year's the last chance we'll get to finally see our\n"
p1341
ag11
aS"Oliver, this year's our year,"
p1342
aS"We'll do it, Oliver!"
p1343
aS'Definitely,'
p1344
aS'First Hogsmeade weekend,'
p1345
aS'End of October. Halloween.'
p1346
aS"Harry, I'm sure you'll be able to go next time,"
p1347
aS"They're bound to catch Black soon. He's been sighted once already."
p1348
aS"Black's not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,"
p1349
aS'Ask McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages --'
p1350
aS'Ron!'
p1351
aS"Harry's supposed to stay in school-"
p1352
aS"He can't be the only third year left behind,"
p1353
aS'Ask McGonagall, go on, Harry --'
p1354
aS'Yeah, I think I will,'
p1355
aS'Does he have to eat that in front of us?'
p1356
aS'Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?'
p1357
aS'You can copy mine, if you like,'
p1358
aS"CATCH THAT CAR' Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the\n"
p1359
aS'Look at him!'
p1360
aS"He's skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!"
p1361
aS"Crookshanks doesn't understand it's wrong!"
p1362
aS'All cats chase rats, Ron!'
p1363
aS"There's something funny about that animal!"
p1364
aS'It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag!'
p1365
aS'Oh, what rubbish,'
p1366
aS"Crookshanks could smell him, Ron, how else d'you think --"
p1367
aS"That cat's got it in for Scabbers!"
p1368
aS"And Scabbers was here first, and he's ill!"
p1369
aS"How's Scabbers?"
p1370
aS'Careful, Weasley, careful!'
p1371
aS'She got a letter from home this morning,'
p1372
aS"It's her rabbit, Binky. He's been killed by a fox."
p1373
aS'Oh,'

aS"I'm sorry, Lavender."
p1375
aS'I should have known!'
p1376
aS'You know what day it is?'
p1377
aS'Er --'
p1378
aS"The sixteenth of October! 'That thing you're dreading, it will happen on the sixteenth of October!' Remember? She was right, she was right!"
p1379
aS'You -- you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?'
p1380
aS'Well, not necessarily by a fox,'
p1381
aS"but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn't l?"
p1382
aS'Oh,'
p1383
aS'Was Binky an old rabbit?'
p1384
aS'N -- no!'
p1385
aS'H -- he was only a baby!'
p1386
aS'But then, why would you dread him dying?'
p1387
aS'Well, look at it logically,'
p1388
aS"I mean, Binky didn't even die today, did he? Lavender just got the news today-"
p1389
aS"- and she can't have been dreading it, because it's come as a real shock --"
p1390
aS'One moment, please !'
p1391
aS"As you're\n"
p1392
ag11
aS"Please, Professor, I -- I think I've lost\n"
p1393
aS'Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,'
p1394
aS"She seemed to think it was safer. Well, that's all, you may leave."
p1395
aS'Oh. but --'
p1396
aS'Professor, my aunt and uncle -- er -- forgot to sign my form,'
p1397
aS"So -- er d'you think it would be all right mean, will It be okay if I -- if I go to Hogsmeade?"
p1398
aS"I'm afraid not, Potter,"
p1399
aS"You heard what I said. No form, no visiting the village. That's the rule."
p1400
aS"But I don't say so,"
p1401
aS'The form clearly states that the\n'
p1402
aS' She turned to look at him, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? '
p1403
ag11
aS"They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it's not all it's cracked up to be,"
p1404
aS"All right, the sweetshop's rather good, and Zonko's Joke Shop's frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack's always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from that, you're not missing anything."
p1405
aS"We'll bring you. lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,"
p1406
aS'Yeah, loads,'
p1407
aS"Don't worry about me,"
p1408
aS"I'll see you at the feast. Have a good time."
p1409
aS'Staying here, Potter?'
p1410
aS'Scared of passing the dementors?'
p1411
aS'Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!'
p1412
aS"Aren't you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey"
p1413
aS'you can come and sit with us, if you like, Harry!'
p1414
aS'Er -- no, thanks, Colin,'
p1415
aS"I -- I've got to go to the library, got to get some work done."
p1416
aS'What was the point waking me up?'
p1417
aS'Nothing!'
p1418
aS'A likely\n'
p1419
ag11
aS'What are you doing?'
p1420
aS'Where are Ron and Hermione?'
p1421
aS'Hogsmeade,'
p1422
aS' said Harry. I\n'
p1423
aS'Water demon,'
p1424
aS"We shouldn't have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle."
p1425
aS'Cup of tea?'
p1426
aS'I was just thinking of making one.'
p1427
aS'Sit down,'
p1428
aS"I've only got teabags, I'm afraid -- but I daresay you've had enough of tea leaves?"
p1429
aS'No,'
p1430
aS'Anything worrying you, Harry?'
p1431
aS'Yes,'
p1432
aS'I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,'
p1433
aS'Why?'
p1434
aS'Well,'
p1435
aS'I assumed that if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.'
p1436
aS'Clearly, I was wrong,'
p1437
aS"But I didn't think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom. I imagined that people would panic."
p1438
aS'I see,'
p1439
aS"Well, well... I'm impressed."
p1440
aS'That suggests\n'
p1441
ag11
aS"So you've been thinking that I didn't believe you capable of fighting the boggart?"
p1442
aS'Well... yeah,'
p1443
aS'Professor Lupin, you know the dementors --'
p1444
aS'Come in,'
p1445
aS'Ah, Severus,'
p1446
aS'Thanks very much. Could you leave it here on the desk for me?'
p1447
aS'I was just showing Harry my grindylow,'
p1448
aS'Fascinating,'
p1449
aS'You should drink that directly, Lupin.'
p1450
aS'Yes, Yes, I will,'
p1451
aS'I made an entire cauldronful,'
p1452
aS'If you need more.\n'
p1453
aS'I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.'
p1454
aS'Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,'
p1455
aS'I have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex.'
p1456
aS'Pity sugar makes it useless,'
p1457
aS"I've been feeling a bit off-color,"
p1458
aS"This potion is the only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there aren't many wizards who are up to making it."
p1459
aS"Professor Snape's very interested in the Dark Arts, he blurted out.\n"
p1460
aS'Really?'
p1461
aS'Disgusting,'
p1462
aS"Well, Harry, I'd better get back to work. see you at the feast later."
p1463
aS'Right,'
p1464
aS'There you go,'
p1465
aS'We got as much as we could carry.'
p1466
aS'Thanks,'
p1467
aS"What's Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?"
p1468
aS'The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there!'
p1469
aS"Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples, there's a bit, look --"
p1470
aS'We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks --'
p1471
aS'Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up --'
p1472
aS'What did you do?'
p1473
aS'Did you get any work done?'
p1474
aS'No,'
p1475
aS'Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then Snape came in....'
p1476
aS'Lupin drank it?'
p1477
aS'Is he mad?'
p1478
aS"We'd better go down, you know, the feast'll be starting in fiveminutes They hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still discussing Snape.\n"
p1479
aS'But if he -- you know'
p1480
aS"if he was trying to to poison Lupin -- he wouldn't have done it in front of Harry."
p1481
aS'The dementors send their love, Potter!'
p1482
aS'Let me through, please,'
p1483
aS"What's the holdup here? You can't all have forgotten the password -- excuse me, I'm Head Boy --"
p1484
aS'Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.'
p1485
aS"What's going on?"
p1486
aS'Oh, my --'
p1487
aS'We need to find her,'
p1488
aS'Professor McGonagall, please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle\n'
p1489
ag11
aS"You'll be lucky!"
p1490
aS'What do you mean, Peeves?'
p1491
aS"Ashamed, Your Headship, sit. Doesn't want to be seen. She's a horrible mess. Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the trees. Crying something dreadful,"
p1492
aS'Poor thing,'
p1493
aS'Did she say who did it?'
p1494
aS'Oh yes, Professorhead,'
p1495
aS"He got very angry when she wouldn't let him in, you see."
p1496
aS"Nasty temper he's got, that Sirius Black."
p1497
aS'The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,'
p1498
aS"I'm afraid that, for your own safety,\n"
p1499
ag11
aS'Send word with one of the ghosts.'
p1500
aS"Oh, yes, you'll be needing..."
p1501
aS'Sleep well,'
p1502
aS'Everyone into their sleeping bags!'
p1503
aS'Come on, now, no more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!'
p1504
aS"Do you think Black's still in the castle?"
p1505
aS'Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,'
p1506
aS"It's very lucky he picked tonight, you know,"
p1507
aS"The one night we weren't in the tower...."
p1508
aS' said Ron. '
p1509
ag11
aS'How did he get in?'
p1510
aS'Maybe he knows how to Apparate,'
p1511
aS'Just appear out of thin air, you know.'
p1512
aS'Disguised himself, probably,'
p1513
aS"He could've flown in,"
p1514
aS'Probably,'
p1515
aS'Why?'
p1516
aS"Because the castle's protected by more than walls, You know,,, said Hermione. "
p1517
ag11
aS'The lights are going out now!'
p1518
aS'I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!'
p1519
aS'Any sign of him, Professor?'
p1520
aS'No. All well here?'
p1521
aS'Everything under control, sir.'
p1522
aS"Good. There's no point moving them all now. I've found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You'll be able to move them back in tomorrow."
p1523
aS'And the Fat Lady, sir?'
p1524
aS"Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She's still very distressed, but once she's calmed down, I'll have Mr. Filch restore her."
p1525
aS"What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney's room? The Owlery?"
p1526
aS'All searched.'
p1527
aS"Very well, Severus. I didn't really expect Black to linger."
p1528
aS'You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before -- ah -- the start of term?'
p1529
aS'I do, Severus,'
p1530
aS'It seems -- almost impossible -- that Black could have entered the school without inside help. I did express my concerns whet, you appointed --'
p1531
aS'I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it,'
p1532
aS'I must go down to the dementors,'
p1533
ag11
aS"Didn't they want to help, sit?"
p1534
aS'Oh yes,'
p1535
aS"But I'm afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster."
p1536
aS"He's a complete lunatic,"
p1537
aS"Can't we get anyone else?"
p1538
aS'None of the other pictures wanted the job,'
p1539
aS'Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer.'
p1540
aS"There's no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,"
p1541
aS'I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black --'
p1542
aS"We've got our first match on Saturday!"
p1543
aS"I've got to train, Professor!"
p1544
aS'Hmm...'
p1545
aS"Well... goodness knows, I'd like to see us win the Cup at last... but all the same,\n"
p1546
ag11
aS"We're not playing Slytherin!"
p1547
aS"Flint's just been to see me. We're playing Hufflepuff instead."
p1548
aS'Why?'
p1549
aS"Flint's excuse is that their Seeker's arm's still injured,"
p1550
aS"But it's obvious why they're doing it. Don't want to play in this weather. Think it'll damage their chances...."
p1551
aS"I know that, but we can't prove it,"
p1552
aS"And we've been practicing all those moves assuming we're playing Slytherin, and\n"
p1553
ag11
aS'What?'
p1554
aS"He's that tall, good-looking one, isn't he?"
p1555
aS'Strong and silent,'
p1556
aS"He's only silent because he's too thick to string two words together,"
p1557
aS"I don't know why you're worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the Snitch in about five minutes, remember?"
p1558
aS'We were playing in completely different conditions!'
p1559
aS"Diggory's put a very strong side together! He's\n"
p1560
ag11
aS'Oliver, calm down!'
p1561
aS"We're taking Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously."
p1562
aS'Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!'
p1563
aS"Sorry I'm late, Professor Lupin. I --"
p1564
aS"This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we'll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down."
p1565
aS"Where's Professor Lupin?"
p1566
aS'He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,'
p1567
aS'I believe I told you to sit down?'
p1568
aS'Nothing life-threatening,'
p1569
aS'Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.'
p1570
aS'As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far --'
p1571
aS"Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,"
p1572
aS"and we're just about to start --"
p1573
aS'Be quiet,'
p1574
aS"I did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin's lack of organization."
p1575
aS"He's the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had,"
p1576
aS'You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I ,Would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall discuss --'
p1577
aS'Werewolves,'
p1578
aS'But, sir,'
p1579
aS"we're not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --"
p1580
aS'Miss Granger,'
p1581
aS'I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394.'
p1582
ag11
aS'Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf?'
p1583
aS'Anyone?'
p1584
aS"Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you the basic distinction between --"
p1585
aS'We told you,'
p1586
aS"we haven't got as far as werewolves yet, we're still on --"
p1587
aS'Silence!'
p1588
aS"Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a third-year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are...."
p1589
aS'Please, sir,'
p1590
aS'the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf --'
p1591
aS'That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,'
p1592
aS'Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.'
p1593
aS'You asked us\n'
p1594
ag11
aS'Detention, Weasley,'
p1595
aS'And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.'
p1596
aS"Very poorly explained... That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia.... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn't have given it three...."
p1597
aS'You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment or, the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention.'
p1598
aS"I don't know,"
p1599
aS'But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon....'
p1600
aS"D'you know what that --"
p1601
aS'Ron!'
p1602
aS"-- is making me do? I've got to scrub out the bedpans in\n"
p1603
aS' He was breathing deeply, his fists clenched. '
p1604
ag11
aS"It's going to be a tough one,"
p1605
aS'Stop worrying, Oliver,'
p1606
aS"we don't mind a bit of rain."
p1607
aS'I called for time-out!'
p1608
aS'Come on, under here --'
p1609
aS"What's the score?"
p1610
aS"We're fifty points up,"
p1611
aS"but unless we get the Snitch soon, we'll be playing into the night."
p1612
aS"I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!"
p1613
aS'Impervius!'
p1614
aS'There!'
p1615
aS"They'll repel water!"
p1616
aS'Brilliant!'
p1617
aS"Okay, team, let's go for it!"
p1618
aS'Harry!'
p1619
aS'Harry, behind you!'
p1620
aS'Come on!'
p1621
ag11
aS'Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!'
p1622
aS'Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now....'
p1623
aS'Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --'
p1624
aS'Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy....\n'
p1625
aS'Lucky the ground was so soft.'
p1626
aS'I thought he was dead for sure.'
p1627
aS"But he didn't even break his glasses."
p1628
aS"That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life."
p1629
aS'Harry!'
p1630
aS"How're you feeling?"
p1631
aS'What happened?'
p1632
aS'You fell off,'
p1633
aS"Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?"
p1634
aS"We thought you'd died,"
p1635
aS'But the match,'
p1636
aS'What happened? Are we doing a replay?'
p1637
aS'Diggory got the Snitch,'
p1638
aS"Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square... even Wood admits it."
p1639
aS'Where is Wood?'
p1640
aS'Still in the showers,'
p1641
aS"We think he's trying to drown himself."
p1642
aS"C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch before."
p1643
aS"There had to be one time you didn't get it,"
p1644
aS"It's not over yet,"
p1645
aS'We lost by a hundred points'
p1646
aS'Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin --.'
p1647
aS"Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points,"
p1648
aS'But if they beat Ravenclaw...'
p1649
aS'No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff...'
p1650
aS'It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way.'
p1651
aS"We'll come and see you later,"
p1652
aS"Don't beat yourself up, Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had."
p1653
aS'Dumbledore was really angry,'
p1654
aS"I've never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell,\n"
p1655
ag11
aS'Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,'
p1656
aS'And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --'
p1657
aS'Did someone get my Nimbus?'
p1658
aS'Er --'
p1659
aS'What?'
p1660
aS'Well... when you fell off, it got blown away,'
p1661
aS'And?'
p1662
aS'And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow.'
p1663
aS'And?'
p1664
aS'Well, you know the Whomping Willow,'
p1665
aS"It -- it doesn't like being hit."
p1666
aS'Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said Hermione in a very small voice.\n'
p1667
aS"It's okay!"
p1668
aS"It's not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?"
p1669
aS"We don't know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment!"
p1670
aS"Did you tell Professor Snape we haven't covered them yet?"
p1671
aS"Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen --"
p1672
aS'-- two rolls of parchment!'
p1673
aS"Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the essay."
p1674
aS'Oh no,'
p1675
aS"I've already finished it!"
p1676
aS'Lures travelers into bogs,'
p1677
aS'You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -people follow the light -- then --'
p1678
aS'Wait a moment, Harry,'
p1679
aS"I'd like a word."
p1680
aS'I heard about the match,'
p1681
aS"and I'm sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?"
p1682
aS'No,'
p1683
aS'The tree smashed it to bits.'
p1684
aS'They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye,\n'
p1685
ag11
aS"Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds.... I suppose they were the\n"
p1686
ag11
aS'Yes,'
p1687
aS' Why? Why do they affect me like that? Am I just --?'
p1688
aS'It has nothing to do with weakness,'
p1689
aS"The dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't have."
p1690
aS'Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair,\n'
p1691
ag11
aS"They're getting hungry,"
p1692
aS"Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up.... I don't think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotions running high... it was their idea of a feast."
p1693
aS"The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought. Most of them go mad within weeks."
p1694
aS'Yes,'
p1695
aS"Black must have found a way to fight them. I wouldn't have believed it possible.... Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long...."
p1696
aS'There are -- certain defenses one can use,'
p1697
aS'But there was only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult it becomes to resist.'
p1698
aS"I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the contrary..."
p1699
aS'But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able to fight them --'
p1700
aS"Well... all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next\n"
p1701

p1704
aS"We've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,"
p1705
aS'Come in here....'
p1706
aS'Early Christmas present for you, Harry,'
p1707
aS"What's that supposed to be?"
p1708
aS'This, Harry, is the secret of our success,'
p1709
aS"It's a wrench, giving it to you,"
p1710
aS"but we decided last night, your need's greater than ours."
p1711
aS'Anyway, we know it by heart,'
p1712
aS"We bequeath it to you. We don't really need it anymore."
p1713
aS'And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?'
p1714
aS'Well... when we were in our first year, Harry -- young, carefree, and innocent --'
p1715
aS'Well, more innocent than we are now -- we got into a spot of bother with Filch.'
p1716
aS'We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason --'
p1717
aS'So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual --'
p1718
aS"Don't tell me --"
p1719
aS"Well, what would you've done?"
p1720
aS'George caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed -- this.'
p1721
aS"It's not as bad as it sounds, you know,"
p1722
aS"We don't reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn't have confiscated it."
p1723
aS'And you know how to work it?'
p1724
aS'Oh yes,'
p1725
aS"This little beauty's taught us more than all the teachers in this school."

p1728
aS'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.'
p1729
aS'Right into Hogsmeade,'
p1730
aS'There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four'
p1731
aS"but we're sure we're the only ones who know about these. Don't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it's caved in -- completely blocked.\n"

p1741

p1742
aS'Mischief managed!'
p1743
aS"And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they've nearly cleaned us out --"
p1744
aS"Ugh, no, Harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, I expect,"
p1745
aS'How about these?'
p1746
aS'Harry!'
p1747
aS'What are you doing here? How -- how did you --?'
p1748
aS'Wow!'
p1749
aS"you've learned to Apparate!"
p1750
aS"'Course I haven't,"
p1751

p1752
aS"I'm their brother!"
p1753
aS"But Harry isn't going to keep it!"
p1754
aS"He's going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall, aren't you, Harry?"
p1755
aS"No, I'm not!"
p1756
aS'Are you mad?'
p1757
aS'Hand in something that good?'
p1758
aS"If I hand it in, I'll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred and George had nicked it!"
p1759
aS'But what about Sirius Black?'
p1760
aS'He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have\n'
p1761
ag11
aS"He'd have a job spotting Harry in this,"
p1762
aS"Come on, Hermione, it's Christmas. Harry deserves a break."
p1763
aS'Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?'
p1764
aS'And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred\n'
p1765
aS' Ron stared broodingly into the Acid Pop box. '
p1766
ag11
aS"That's the post office\n"
p1767
aS"Zonko's is up there --"
p1768
aS'We could go up to the Shrieking Shack\n'
p1769
aS'Tell you what,'
p1770
aS'shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?'
p1771
aS"That's Madam Rosmerta,"
p1772
aS"I'll get the drinks, shall I?"
p1773
aS'Merry Christmas!'
p1774
ag11
aS'A small gillywater --'
p1775
aS'Mine,'
p1776
aS'Four pints of mulled mead --'
p1777
aS'Ta, Rosmerta,'
p1778
aS'A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella --'
p1779
aS'Mmm!'
p1780
aS"So you'll be the red currant rum, Minister."
p1781
aS"Thank you, Rosmerta, m'dear,"
p1782
aS"Lovely to see you again, I must say. Have one yourself, won't you? Come and join us...."
p1783
aS'Well, thank you very much, Minister.'
p1784
aS'So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?'
p1785
ag11
aS' admitted Madam Rosmerta.\n'
p1786
aS'Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?'
p1787
aS'Do you think Blacks still in the area, Minister?'
p1788
aS"I'm sure of it,"
p1789
aS'You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjce?'
p1790
aS"Scared all my customers away... It's very bad for business, Minister."
p1791
aS"Rosmerta, dear, I don't like them any more than you do,"
p1792
aS"Necessary precaution... unfortunate, but there YOU are.... I've just met some of them. They're in a fury against Dumbledore -- he won't let them inside the castle grounds."
p1793
aS'I should think not,'
p1794
aS'How are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?'
p1795
aS'Hear, hear!'
p1796
aS'All the same,'
p1797
aS"they are here to protect you all from something much worse.... We all know what Black's capable of..."
p1798
aS'Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,'
p1799
aS"Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I'd have thought... I mean, I remember him when he was a boy at Hogwarts. If you'd told me then what he was going to become, I'd have said you'd had too much mead."
p1800
aS"You don't know the half of it, Rosmerta,"
p1801
aS"The worst he did isn't widely known."
p1802
aS'The worst?'
p1803
aS'Worse\n'
p1804
aS' '
p1805
aS' said Fudge.\n'
p1806
aS"I ca'A believe that. What could possibly be worse?"
p1807
aS'You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,'
p1808
aS'Do you remember who his-best friend was?'
p1809
aS'Naturally,'
p1810
aS'Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here -- ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!'
p1811
aS'Precisely,'
p1812
aS'Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course -- exceptionally\n'
p1813
ag11
aS'I dunno,'
p1814
aS"Fred and George Weasley could give 'em a run fer their money."
p1815
aS"You'd have thought Black and Potter were brothers!"
p1816
aS'Inseparable!'
p1817
aS'Of course they were,'
p1818
aS'Potter trusted Black beyond all his other friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man when James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry has no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him.'
p1819
aS'Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?'
p1820
aS"Worse even than that, rn'dear...."
p1821
aS'Not many people are aware that the\n'
p1822
ag11
aS'How does that work?'
p1823
aS'An immensely complex spell,'
p1824
aS'involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their\n'
p1825
ag11
aS"So Black was the Potters' Secret-Keeper?"
p1826
aS'Naturally,'
p1827
aS"James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was planning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained worried. I remember him offering to be the Potters' Secret-Keeper himself."
p1828
aS'He suspected Black?'
p1829
aS'He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You-Know-Who informed of their movements,'
p1830
aS'Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to\n'
p1831
ag11
aS'But James Potter insisted on using Black?'
p1832
aS'He did,'
p1833
aS'And then, barely a week after the\n'
p1834
ag1805
aS' breathed Madam Rosmerta.\n'
p1835
aS"He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready to declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters' death. But, as we all know,\n"
p1836
aS"Filthy, stinkin' turncoat!"
p1837
aS'Shh!'
p1838
aS'I met him!'
p1839
aS"I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an' James's house after they was killed! jus' got him outta the ruins, poor little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an' his parents\n"
p1840
aS' Hagrid roared.\n'
p1841
aS'Hagrid, please!'
p1842
aS'Keep your voice down!'
p1843
aS"How was I ter know he wasn' upset abou' Lily an' James? It was You-Know-Who he cared abou'! An' then he says, 'Give Harry ter me, Hagrid, I'm his godfather, I'll look after him --' Ha! But I'd had me\n"
p1844
aS"I shoulda known there was somethin' fishy goin' on then. He loved that motorbike, what was he givin' it ter me for? Why wouldn' he need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he'd bin the Potters' Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin' ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a matter o' hours before the Ministry was\n"
p1845
aS"But what if I'd given Harry to him, eh? I bet he'd 've pitched him off\n"
p1846
ag11
aS"But he didn't manage to disappear, did he? The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day!"
p1847
aS'Alas, if only we had,'
p1848
aS"It was not we who found him. It was little Peter Pettigrew -- another of the Potters' friends. Maddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself."
p1849
aS'Pettigrew... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts?'
p1850
aS'Hero-worshipped Black and Potter,'
p1851
aS'Never quite in their league, talent-wise. I was often rather ,harp with him.\n'
p1852
aS' She sounded as though she had a sudden head cold.\n'
p1853
aS'There, now, Minerva,'
p1854
aS"Pettigrew died a hero's death. Eyewitnesses -- Muggles, of course, we wiped their, memories later -- told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing, 'Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?' And then he went for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens...."
p1855
aS'Stupid boy ... foolish boy... he was always hopeless at dueling... should have left it to the Ministry....'
p1856
aS"I tell yeh, if I'd got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I\n"
p1857
aS' Hagrid growled.\n'
p1858
aS"You don't know what you're talking about, Hagrid,"
p1859
aS'Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time,\n'
p1860
ag11
aS'Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,'
p1861
aS'Black was\n'
p1862
ag11
aS"Is it true he's mad, Minister?"
p1863
aS'I wish I could say that he was,'
p1864
aS'I certainly\n'
p1865
ag11
aS"But what do you think he's broken out to do?"
p1866
aS"Good gracious, Minister, he isn't trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?"
p1867
aS' said Fudge evasively.\n'
p1868
aS"But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing... but give him back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again...."
p1869
aS"You know, Cornelius, if you're dining with the headmaster, he'd better head back up to the castle,"
p1870
aS'Harry?'
p1871
aS'Harry?'
p1872
aS'Harry, you -- you look terrible.'
p1873
aS'Where is everyone?'
p1874
aS"You really don' look well, you know,"
p1875
aS"I'm fine,"
p1876
aS'Harry, listen,'
p1877
ag11
aS'Like what?'
p1878
aS"You won't, will you, Harry?"
p1879
aS"Because Black's not worth dying for,"
p1880
ag11
aS"There's nothing you can do!"
p1881
aS"The dementors will catch Black and he'll go back to Azkaban and -- and serve him right!"
p1882
aS"You heard what Fudge said. Black isn't affected by Azkaban like normal people are. It's not a punishment for him like it is for the others."
p1883
aS'So what are you saying?'
p1884
aS'You want to -- to kill Black or something?'
p1885
aS"Don't be silly,"
p1886
aS"Harry doesn't want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?"
p1887
aS' he said abruptly. '
p1888
aS"Malfoy's dad must have told him,"
p1889
aS"He was right in Voldemort's inner circle --"
p1890
aS'-- so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort --'
p1891
aS"-- and Malfoy'd love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy's just hoping you'll get Yourself killed before he has to play you at Quidditch."
p1892
aS'Harry, please,'
p1893
aS"Please be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don't Put\n"
p1894
ag11
aS'Look,'
p1895
aS"it's the holidays! It's nearly Christmas! Let's -- let's go down and see Hagrid. We haven't visited him for ages!"
p1896
aS'No!'
p1897
aS"Harry isn't supposed to leave the castle, Ron --"
p1898
aS"Yeah, let's go,"
p1899
aS'and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!'
p1900
aS'Or we could have a game of chess, he said hastily, '
p1901
ag11
aS'Stand and fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!'
p1902
aS"He's not out, is he?"
p1903
aS"There's a weird noise,"
p1904
aS'Listen -- is that Fang?'
p1905
aS'YWve heard?'
p1906
aS'Hagrid, what is it?'
p1907
aS"What's this, Hagrid?"
p1908
aS'Oh,'
p1909
aS"But you said Buckbeak isn't a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I bet he'll get off\n"
p1910
aS"Yeh don' know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous Creatures!"
p1911
aS"They've got it in fer interestin' creatures!"
p1912
aS"I couldn' leave him tied up out there in the snow!"
p1913
aS'All on his own! At Christmas.'
p1914
aS'interesting creatures'
p1915
aS'terrifying monsters.'
p1916
aS"You'll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,"
p1917
aS"I'm sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe."
p1918
aS"Won't make no diff'rence!"
p1919
aS"Them Disposal devils, they're all in Lucius Malfoy's pocket! Scared o' him! Ad if I lose the case, Buckbeak --"
p1920
aS'What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?'
p1921
aS"He's done more'n enough fer me already,"
p1922
aS"Got enough on his plate what with keepin' them dementors outta the castle, an' Sirius\n"
p1923
ag11
aS'Listen, Hagrid,'
p1924
aS"you can't give up. Hermione's right, You just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses --"
p1925
aS"I'm sure I've read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,"
p1926
aS"where the hippogriff got off I'll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened."
p1927
aS'Er -- shall I make a cup of tea?'
p1928
aS"Yer right. I can' afford to go ter pieces. Gotta\n"
p1929
aS"I've not bin meself lately,"
p1930
aS"Worried abou' Buckbeak, an' no one likin' me classes --"
p1931
aS'We do like them!'
p1932
aS"Yeah, they're great!"
p1933
aS'Er -- how are the flobberworms?'
p1934
aS'Dead,'
p1935
aS'Too much lettuce.'
p1936
aS'Oh no!'
p1937
aS"An' them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an' all,"
p1938
aS"Gotta walk past 'em ev'ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks. 'S like bein' back in Azkaban --"
p1939
aS'Is it awful in there, Hagrid?'
p1940
aS"Yeh've no idea,"
p1941
aS"Never bin anywhere like it. Thought I was goin' mad. Kep' goin' over horrible stuff in me mind... the day I got expelled from Hogwarts... day me dad died... day I had ter let Norbert go...."
p1942
aS"Yeh can' really remember who yeh are after a while. An' yeh can' really see the point o' livin' at all. I used ter hope I'd jus' die in me\n"
p1943
ag11
aS'But you were innocent!'
p1944
aS"Think that matters to them? They don' care. Long as they've got a couple o' hundred humans stuck there with 'em, so they can leech all the happiness out of 'em, they don' give a damn who's guilty an' who's not."
p1945
aS"Thought o' jus' letting Buckbeak go... tryin' ter make him fly away... but how d'yeh explain ter a hippogriff it's gotta go inter hidin'? An' -an' I'm scared o' breakin' the law...."
p1946
aS"I don' ever want ter go back ter Azkaban."
p1947
aS"Here's something... there was a case in 1722... but the hippogriff was convicted -- ugh, look what they did to it, that's disgusting --"
p1948
aS'This might help, look -- a manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they let the manticore off -- oh -- no, that was only because everyone was\n'
p1949
ag11
aS"What's that?"
p1950
aS'Dunno...'
p1951
aS"I don't believe it,"
p1952
aS"Look and see if there's a card,"
p1953
aS"Nothing! Blimey, who'd spend that much on you?"
p1954
aS'Well,'
p1955
aS"I'm betting it wasn't the Dursleys."
p1956
aS' said Ron, now walking around and around the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. '
p1957
ag11
aS"That was my dad's, though,"
p1958
aS"Dumbledore was just Passing it on to me. He wouldn't spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can't go giving students stuff like this --"
p1959
aS'I know,'
p1960
aS"I know who it could've been -- Lupin!"
p1961
aS'What?'
p1962
aS"Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he'd be able to buy himself some new robes."
p1963
aS'Yeah, but he likes you,'
p1964
aS'And he was away when your Nimbus\n'
p1965
ag11
aS"What d'you mean, he was away?"
p1966
aS'He was ill when I was playing in that match.'
p1967
aS"Well, he wasn't in the hospital wing,"
p1968
aS'I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?'
p1969
aS"I can't see Lupin affording something like this."
p1970
aS"What're you two laughing about?"
p1971
aS"Don't bring him in here!"
p1972
aS'Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?'
p1973
aS'No idea,'
p1974
aS"There wasn't a card or anything with it."
p1975
aS"What's the matter with you?"
p1976
aS"I don't know,"
p1977
aS"but it's a bit odd, isn't it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't it?"
p1978
aS"It's the best broom there is, Hermione,"
p1979
aS"So it must've been really expensive...."
p1980
aS"Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even tell him they'd sent it?"
p1981
aS"I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!"
p1982
aS"What d'you think Harry's going to do with it -- sweep the floor?"
p1983
aS' Harry said, bending down and picking up the Sneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it....\n'
p1984
aS"It's stress!"
p1985
aS"He'd be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone!"
p1986
aS'Merry Christmas!'
p1987
aS'As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables.... Sit down, sit down!'
p1988
aS'Crackers!'
p1989
aS'Dig in!'
p1990
aS'Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!'
p1991
aS'I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,'
p1992
aS'and to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness....'
p1993
aS'Certainly, certainly,'
p1994
aS'Let me draw you up a chair --'
p1995
ag11
aS"We'll risk it, Sibyll,"
p1996
aS"Do sit down, the turkey's getting stone cold."
p1997
aS'Tripe, Sibyll?'
p1998
aS'But where is dear Professor Lupin?'
p1999
aS"I'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again,"
p2000
aS'Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.'
p2001
aS'But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?'
p2002
aS'Certainly I knew, Minerva, 11 she said quietly. '
p2003
aS'That explains a great deal,'
p2004
aS'If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him --'
p2005
aS'Imagine that,'
p2006
aS' said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice,\n'
p2007
aS"that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus, you've made the potion for him again?"
p2008
aS'Yes, Headmaster,'
p2009
aS'W -- what?'
p2010
aS'Why?'
p2011
aS'It will need to be checked for jinxes,'
p2012
aS"Of course, I'm no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down --"
p2013
aS'Strip it down?'
p2014
aS"It shouldn't take more than a few weeks,"
p2015
aS'You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.'
p2016
aS"There's nothing wrong with it!"
p2017
aS'Honestly, Professor --'
p2018
aS"You can't know that, Potter,"
p2019
aS"not until you've flown it, at any rate, and I'm afraid that is out of\n"
p2020
ag11
aS'What did you go running to McGonagall for?\n'
p2021
aS'Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!'
p2022
aS'Had a good Christmas?'
p2023
aS"I've been, doing some thinking over Christmas, Harry. After last match, you know. If the dementors come to the next one... I mean... we can't afford you to --\n"
p2024
ag11
aS'Ah,'
p2025
aS'Well, in that case -- I\n'
p2026
ag11
aS'No,'
p2027
aS"What! You'd better get a move on, you know -- you can't ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!"
p2028
aS'He got a Firebolt for Christmas,'
p2029
aS'A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A -- a real Firebolt?'
p2030
aS'Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?'
p2031
aS"But Black couldn't have bought a Firebolt! He's on the run! The whole country's on the lookout for him! How could he just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?"
p2032
aS'I know,'
p2033
aS'but McGonagall still wants to strip it down --'
p2034
aS"I'll go and talk to her, Harry,"
p2035
aS"I'll make her see reason.... A Firebolt... a real Firebolt, on our team... She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we do.... I'll make her see sense. A Firebolt..."
p2036
ag11
aS"What d'you reckon's the matter with him?"
p2037
aS'tuh'
p2038
aS'Nothing,'
p2039
aS'Yes, you were,'
p2040
aS"I said I wonder what's wrong with Lupin, and you --"
p2041
aS"Well, isn't it obvious?"
p2042
aS"If you don't want to tell us, don't,"
p2043
aS'Fine,'
p2044
aS"She doesn't know,"
p2045
aS"She's just trying to get us to talk to her again."
p2046
aS"What's that?"
p2047
aS'Another boggart,'
p2048
aS"I've been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch's filing cabinet. It's the nearest we'll\n"
p2049
ag11
aS'Okay,'
p2050
aS'Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,'
p2051
aS'which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.'
p2052
aS'With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.'
p2053
aS'Right,'
p2054
aS'The incantation is this --'
p2055
aS'Expecto patronum!'
p2056
aS'Concentrating hard on your happy memory?'
p2057
aS'Oh -- yeah --'
p2058
aS'Expecto patrono -- no, patronum -- sorry -- expecto patronum, expecto patronum'
p2059
aS'Very good,'
p2060
aS'Right, then -- ready to try it on a dementor?'
p2061
ag11
aS'Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!'
p2062
aS'Harry!'
p2063
aS'Sorry,'
p2064
aS'Are you all right?'
p2065
aS'Here --'
p2066
aS"Eat this before we try again. I didn't expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had."
p2067
aS"Harry, if you don't want to continue, I will more than understand --"
p2068
aS"I've got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match\n"
p2069
ag11
aS'All right then... '
p2070
aS"You might want to select 'other\n"
p2071
ag11
aS'Ready?'
p2072
aS'Ready,'
p2073
aS"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off --"
p2074
aS'Harry! Harry... wake up....'
p2075
aS'You heard James?'
p2076
aS'I -- I did, as a matter of fact,'
p2077
aS"We were friends at Hogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight. This charm is ridiculously advanced.... I shouln't have suggested putting you through this...."
p2078
aS'No!'
p2079
aS"I'll have one more go! I'm not thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is.... Hang on...."
p2080
aS'Ready?'
p2081
aS'Concentrating hard? All right -- go!'
p2082
aS' Harry bellowed. '
p2083
aS'Riddikulus!'
p2084
aS'Can we have another go? Just one more go?'
p2085
aS'Not now,'
p2086
aS"You've had enough for one night. Here --"
p2087
aS'Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next week?'
p2088
aS'Okay,'
p2089
aS'Professor Lupin?'
p2090
aS"If you knew my dad, you must've known Sirius Black as well."
p2091
aS'What gives you that idea?'
p2092
aS'Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too....'
p2093
aS'Yes, I knew him,'
p2094
aS"Or I thought I did. You'd better be off, Harry, it's getting late."
p2095
aS"They're dead,"
p2096
aS"They're dead and listening to echoes of them won't bring them back. You'd better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup."
p2097
aS'Doing what?'
p2098
ag11
aS"Bad news, Harry. I've just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt. She -- er -- got a bit shirty with me. Told m' I'd got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn't care\n"
p2099
aS' Wood shook\n'
p2100
aS"Honestly, the way she was yelling at me... you'd\n"
p2101
ag11
aS"No, Potter, you can't have it back yet,"
p2102
aS"We've checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you\n"
p2103
ag11
aS"You're expecting too much of yourself,"
p2104
aS"For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren't passing out anymore, are you?"
p2105
aS' said Harry dispiritedly. '
p2106
ag11
aS'The true Patronus does do that,'
p2107
aS"But you've achieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, You will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground."
p2108
aS"You said it's harder if there are loads of them,"
p2109
aS'I have complete confidence in you,'
p2110
aS'Here --\n'
p2111
ag11
aS'Butterbeer!'
p2112
aS'Yeah, I like that stuff!'
p2113
aS' said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. '
p2114
aS' he added hastily\n'
p2115
aS"What's under a dementor's hood?"
p2116
aS'Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon.'
p2117
aS"What's that?"
p2118
aS"They call it the Dementor's Kiss,"
p2119
aS"It's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his soul."
p2120
aS'Oh no,'
p2121
aS"Much worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no. .. anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just exist. As an empty\n"
p2122
ag11
aS"It's the fate that\n"
p2123
ag11
aS'He deserves it,'
p2124
aS'You think so?'
p2125
aS'Do you really think anyone deserves that?'
p2126
aS"Do watch where you're going, Potter!"
p2127
aS'Sorry, Professor --'
p2128
aS"I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well, here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friend somewhere, Potter...."
p2129
aS'Seriously,'
p2130
aS"I daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won't you? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of the running for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night...."
p2131
aS'She gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? Tomorrow?'
p2132
aS'Yeah... anything,'
p2133
aS'You know what -- we should make up with Hermione.... She was only trying to help....'
p2134
aS'Yeah, all right,'
p2135
aS"She's in the common room how working, for a change --"
p2136
aS'I wrote them down!'
p2137
aS"But I must've dropped them somewhere!"
p2138
ag11
aS"I've lost the passwords!"
p2139
aS"I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now I don't know what I've done with them!"
p2140
aS"Where'd you get it, Harry?"
p2141
aS'Will you let me have a go?'
p2142
aS'Have you ridden it yet, Harry?'
p2143
aS"Ravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on Cleansweep Sevens!"
p2144
aS'Can I just hold it, Harry?'
p2145
aS'I got it back,'
p2146
aS"See, Hermione? There wasn't anything wrong with it!"
p2147
aS'Well -- there might have been!'
p2148
aS"I mean, at least you know now that it's safe!"
p2149
aS'Yeah, I suppose so,'
p2150
aS'Id better put it upstairs.'
p2151
aS'I suppose so,'
p2152
aS"I couldn't do that!"
p2153
aS'Arithmancy looks terrible,'
p2154
aS"Oh no, it's wonderful!"
p2155
aS"It's my favorite subject! It's --"
p2156
aS'LOOK!'
p2157
aS'LOOK!'
p2158
aS'Ron, what --?'
p2159
aS'N -- no,'
p2160
aS'Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!'
p2161
aS"First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave me alone, Harry, I've got a lot of work to do!"
p2162
aS'Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,'
p2163
aS"And he's been off-color for ages, he was wasting away. It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly -- one swallow -- he probably didn't feel a thing."
p2164
aS'Fred!'
p2165
aS'All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,'
p2166
aS"Yeah, that's true,"
p2167
aS'His finest hour,'
p2168
aS"Let the scar on Goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh,\n"
p2169
ag11
aS"Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it's a\n"
p2170
ag11
aS'Er -- Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to practice....'
p2171
aS'Oh -- right -- here you are, then, Potter,'
p2172
aS"I'll sit over here with Weasley...."
p2173
aS"Harry, I've just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It's Cho Chang. She's a fourth year, and she's pretty good.... I really hoped she wouldn't be fit, she's had some problems with injuries...."
p2174
aS'On the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt.'
p2175
aS"Okay, everyone, let's go -- "
p2176
aS"Harry, I'm letting the Snitch out!"
p2177
aS"I can't see what's going to stop us tomorrow!"
p2178
aS"Not unless -- Harry, you've sorted out your dementor problem, haven't you?"
p2179
aS'Yeah,'
p2180
aS"The dementors won't turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore'd go ballistic,"
p2181
aS"Well, let's hope not,"
p2182
aS"Anyway -- good work, everyone. Let's get back to the tower... turn in early --"
p2183
aS"What's the matter?"
p2184
aS'Put it here, Harry,'
p2185
aS'Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!'
p2186
aS'Penelope and I have got a bet on,'
p2187
aS'Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!'
p2188
aS'Harry -- make sure you win,'
p2189
aS"I haven't got ten Galleons. Yes, I'm coming, Penny!"
p2190
aS'Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?'
p2191
aS"Got plenty of special features, hasn't it?"
p2192
aS"Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- in case you get too near a dementor."
p2193
aS"Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,"
p2194
aS'Then it could catch the Snitch for you.'
p2195
aS"You know what we've got to do,"
p2196
aS"If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just --\n"
p2197
ag11
aS'Wood, Davies, shake hands,'
p2198
aS'Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --'
p2199
aS"They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt's going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year's World Championship --"
p2200
aS"Jordan, would you mind telling us what's going on in the match?"
p2201
aS'Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information -- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --'
p2202
aS'Jordan!'
p2203
aS'Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading for goal...'
p2204
aS'Show her your acceleration, Harry!'
p2205
aS"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter's really putting it through its paces now, see it turn -- Chang's Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt's precision- balance is really noticeable in these long --"
p2206
ag11
aS'KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!'
p2207
aS'Expecto patronum!'
p2208
aS'Well done, Harry!'
p2209
aS'Ten Galleons to me! Must find Penelope, excuse me --'
p2210
aS'Good for you, Harry!'
p2211
aS'Ruddy brilliant!'
p2212
aS'That was quite some Patronus,'
p2213
aS"That would be because they -- er -- weren't dementors,"
p2214
aS'Come and see -- '
p2215
aS'You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,'
p2216
aS'An unworthy trick!'
p2217
aS'A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty\n'
p2218
ag11
aS'Come on, Harry!'
p2219
aS'Party! Gryffindor common room, now!'
p2220
aS'Right,'
p2221
aS'How did you do that?'
p2222
aS'With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,'
p2223
aS'Did you even come to the match?'
p2224
aS'Of course I did,'
p2225
aS"And I'm very glad we won, and I think you did really well, but I need to read this by Monday."
p2226
aS"I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to\n"
p2227
aS' said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. '
p2228
aS' She glanced over at Ron too. '
p2229
ag11
aS"If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them --"
p2230
aS'AAARRGGHH! NOOO!'
p2231
aS"What's going on?"
p2232
aS'Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!'
p2233
aS'What?'
p2234
aS'Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!'
p2235
aS"You sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?"
p2236
aS'Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!'
p2237
aS'Who shouted?'
p2238
aS"What're you doing?"
p2239
aS"Are you sure you weren't dreaming, Ron?"
p2240
aS"I'm telling you, I saw him!"
p2241
aS"What's all the noise?"
p2242
aS'Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!'
p2243
aS'Everyone back upstairs!'
p2244
aS'Nonsense!'
p2245
aS'You had too much to eat, Ron -- had a nightmare --'
p2246
aS"I'm telling you --"
p2247
aS"Now, really, enough's enough!"
p2248
aS'I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!'
p2249
aS"I certainly didn't authorize this, Professor!"
p2250
aS'I was just telling them all to get back to bed! My brother Ron here had a nightmare --'
p2251
aS"Don't be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole?"
p2252
aS'Ask him!'
p2253
aS'Ask him if he saw --'
p2254
aS'Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?'
p2255
aS'Certainly, good lady!'
p2256
aS'You -- you did?'
p2257
aS'But -- but the password!'
p2258
aS"He had 'em!"
p2259
aS"Had the whole week's, my lady! Read 'em off a little piece of paper!"
p2260
aS'Which person,'
p2261
aS"which abysmally foolish person wrote down this week's passwords and left them lying around?"
p2262
aS'... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was\n'
p2263
aS'Ouch! Oh -- thanks, Hedwig.'
p2264
aS'He probably wants to hear all about Black!'
p2265
aS'All right, Hagrid!'
p2266
aS"S'pose you want to hear about Saturday night, do you?"
p2267
aS"I've already heard all abou' it,"
p2268
aS'Oh,'
p2269
aS'What are they for, Hagrid?'
p2270
aS"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o' Dangerous Creatures,"
p2271
aS"This Friday. Him an' me'll be goin' down ter London together. I've booked two beds on the Knight Bus...."
p2272
aS' said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.\n'
p2273
aS'What?'
p2274
aS'Hermione,'
p2275
aS'What about her?'
p2276
aS"She's in a righ' state, that's what. She's bin comin' down ter visit me a lot since Chris'mas. Bin feelin' lonely. Firs' yeh weren' talking to her because o' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin' to her because her cat --"
p2277
aS'Because her cat acted like all cats do,'
p2278
aS"She's cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin' through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she's tryin' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak's case, mind.... She's found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he'll stand\n"
p2279
ag11
aS"I'm not blamin' yeh!"
p2280
aS"Gawd knows yeh've had enough ter be gettin' on with. I've seen yeh practicin' Quidditch ev'ry hour o' the day an' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, I\n"
p2281
ag11
aS"Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She's got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an' you two not talkin' to her --"
p2282
aS"Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou' their pets,"
p2283
aS"Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall about that map!"
p2284
aS'Can you hear someone talking, Harry?'
p2285
aS"Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you! I mean it, I'll tell --"
p2286
aS"Harry! I forgot you weren't going to Hogsmeade either!"
p2287
aS'Hi, Neville,'
p2288
aS'What are you up to?'
p2289
aS'Nothing,'
p2290
aS'Want a game of Exploding Snap?'

aS'We just -- met here.'
p2299
aS'Indeed?'
p2300
aS'You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason.... I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.'

p2307
aS"Suppose You'd love to live here, wouldn't you, Weasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room -- is that true?"

aS'He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley -- apparently alone.'
p2321
aS'Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think that could have happened?'
p2322
aS'Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?'
p2323
aS'No,'
p2324
aS'It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.'
p2325
aS"Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey,"
p2326
aS"If he's seeing things like --"
p2327
aS'What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?'
p2328
aS'Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade.'
p2329
aS'I know that,'
p2330
aS"It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --"
p2331
aS'Malfoy is not having hallucinations,'
p2332
aS'If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.'
p2333
aS"I've been up in Gryffindor Tower,"

aS'Like you told --'

aS'Can anyone confirm that?'
p2336
aS'So,'

aS'Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to, with no thought for the consequences.\n'
p2338
aS'How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,'
p2339
aS'He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends\n'
p2340
ag11
aS"My dad didn't strut,"
p2341
aS'And neither do I.'
p2342
aS"Your father didn't set much store by rules either,"
p2343
aS'Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen --'
p2344
aS'What did you say to me, Potter?'
p2345
ag11
aS'And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life?'
p2346
aS"Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears?"
p2347
aS' he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. '
p2348
ag11
aS'Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them out, Potter!'
p2349
aS"Indeed? And you've been carrying them around ever since? How very touching... and what is this?"
p2350
aS'Spare bit of parchment,'
p2351
aS"Surely you don't need such a very old piece of parchment?"
p2352
aS"Why don't I just -- throw this away?"
p2353
aS'So!'
p2354
aS'Is this another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it -- something else? A letter, perhaps, written in invisible ink? Or -- instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the dementors?'

aS'Let me see, let me see....'
p2356
aS'Reveal your secret!'

p2364
aS'Lupin!'
p2365
aS'I want a word!'
p2366
aS'You called, Severus?'
p2367
aS'I certainly did,'
p2368
aS'I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was carrying this.'
p2369
aS'Well?'
p2370
aS'Well?'
p2371
aS'This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic. This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing?'
p2372
aS'Full of Dark Magic?'
p2373
aS'Do you really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop --'
p2374
aS'Indeed?'
p2375
aS"You think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don't think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?"
p2376
aS'You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?'
p2377
aS'Harry, do you know any of these men?'
p2378
aS'You see, Severus?'
p2379
aS'It looks like a Zonko product to me --'
p2380
aS'I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff,'
p2381
aS"Bought -- it... in Zonko's... ages -- ago..."
p2382
aS'Well!'
p2383
aS"That seems to clear that up! Severus, I'll take this back,\n"
p2384
aS' He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. '
p2385
ag11
aS'Professor, I --'
p2386
ag11
aS'Because...,'
p2387
aS"because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school. They'd think it extremely entertaining."
p2388
aS'Do you know them?'
p2389
aS"Don't expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you\n"
p2390
ag11
aS'No,'
p2391
aS'I just thought you ought to know... Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.'
p2392
aS' Hermione said, holding out the letter.\n'
p2393
aS"They can't do this,"
p2394
aS"They can't. Buckbeak isn't dangerous."
p2395
aS"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,"
p2396
aS"You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always is. Only I can't see any hope.... Nothing will have changed."
p2397
aS'Oh, Ron!'
p2398
aS"Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers..."
p2399
aS'Oh -- well -- he was old,'
p2400
aS'And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.'
p2401
aS"S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in\n"
p2402
ag11
aS"S'no good, Ron,"
p2403
aS"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make sure the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. I owe him\n"
p2404
ag11
aS'Look at him blubber!'
p2405
aS'Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?'
p2406
aS"And he's supposed to be our teacher!"
p2407
aS"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul -- you evil --"
p2408
aS'Get off, Ron!'
p2409
aS"C'mon,"
p2410
aS"Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!"
p2411
aS"You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin wins!"
p2412
aS"We're due in Charms,"
p2413
aS"We'd better go."
p2414
aS"Where's Hermione gone?"
p2415

p2420
aS"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes,"
p2421
aS"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?"
p2422
aS'What? Oh no!'
p2423
aS'I forgot to go to Charms!'
p2424
aS'But how could you forget?'
p2425
aS'You were with us till we were right outside the classroom!'
p2426
aS"I don't believe it!"
p2427
aS'Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!'
p2428
aS'You know what, Hermione?'
p2429
aS"I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much."
p2430
aS"No, I'm not!"
p2431
aS"I just made a mistake, that's all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... I'll see you in Divination!"
p2432
aS"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!"
p2433
aS'Good day to you!'
p2434
aS'I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I\n'
p2435

p2438

p2439
aS'This is such a waste of time,'
p2440
aS'I could be practicing something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms --'
p2441
aS'Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?'
p2442
aS' Ron whispered. '
p2443
ag11
aS'There is something here!'
p2444
aS'Something moving... but what is it?'
p2445
aS'My dear Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. '
p2446
ag11
aS"Oh, for goodness' sake!"
p2447
aS'Not that ridiculous Grim again!'
p2448
aS"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane."
p2449
aS'Fine!'
p2450
aS'Fine!'
p2451
aS'Ooooo!'
p2452
aS"Ooooo, Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn't\n"
p2453
ag11
aS'Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs.... The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know...'
p2454
aS'Call this a holiday!'
p2455
aS"The exams are ages away, what're they playing at?"
p2456
aS"So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up,"
p2457
ag11
aS"I can't work, I can't concentrate,"
p2458
aS"You're going to be fine,"
p2459
aS"You've got a Firebolt!"
p2460
aS'Yeah...'
p2461
aS'Team! Bed!'
p2462
aS'Huh?'
p2463
ag11
aS'Down here --'
p2464

p2470
aS'boos'
p2471
aS"And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He's Made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill\n"

p2473
aS'Mount your brooms!'
p2474

aS'Come on, Alicia!'
p2483
aS"YES! SHE'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!"
p2484
aS"'Course, Wood's a superb Keeper!"

p2490
aS'Ha haaa!'
p2491
aS"Too bad, boys! You'll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebold And it's Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle -- Flint alongside her -- poke him\n"

p2503
aS"Yeh beat 'em, Harry, yeh beat 'em!\n"
p2504
aS' There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.\n'
p2505
ag11
aS'What?'
p2506
aS'Yes, of course I have.'
p2507
aS"Is there any point asking how you're going to sit for two exams at once?"
p2508
aS'No,'
p2509
aS'Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Gramatica?'
p2510
aS'Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,'

p2515
aS'P -- P -- Professor McGonagall!'
p2516

p2517
aS'Hello there, Harry!'
p2518

p2521
aS'Pity... pity...'
p2522
aS"I'm here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in."
p2523
aS"No, no, it's scheduled for this afternoon,"
p2524
aS'Then you might not have to witness an execution at A!'
p2525
aS'The hippogriff might get off!'
p2526
aS"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can't go saying things like that to his boss!"
p2527
aS"As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly, they can't possibly execute Buckbeak...."
p2528
aS"She's seeing us all separately,"
p2529
aS'Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball?'
p2530
aS'What did she ask? Was it okay?'
p2531
aS"That's convenient,"
p2532
aS"You know, I'm starting to think Hermione was right about her"
p2533
aS"she's a right old fraud."
p2534
aS'Yeah,'
p2535
aS"Wish she'd hurry up..."
p2536

p2538
aS'Rubbish,'

aS'If you would kindly gaze into the Orb.... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it....'

p2544
aS'Er --'
p2545
aS'a dark shape... um...'
p2546
aS'A hippogriff,'
p2547
aS'Indeed!'
p2548
aS"My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?"
p2549
aS'Are you sure?'
p2550
aS"Are you quite sure, dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?"
p2551
aS'No!'
p2552
aS'No blood? No weeping Hagrid?'
p2553
aS"Well, dear, I think we'll leave it there.... A little disappointing... but I'm sure you did your best."

p2562

aS"I'll do it, Hagrid,"

p2719
aS"The point is, even if you're wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder's Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid's hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied by somebody else."
p2720
aS'What?'
p2721
aS"No, we weren't!"
p2722

p2747
aS'All right, then,'

p2751

p2752
ag11
aS"They didn't see what they thought they saw!"
p2753
aS'Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,'
p2754
aS"I believed it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map never lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry."
p2755
aS"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be true, you know it can't..."
p2756
aS"Why can't it be true?"
p2757
aS"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the list."
p2758
aS'Light again, Hermione!'
p2759
aS'But the Ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.'
p2760
aS"I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,"
p2761
aS"I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer."
p2762
aS"All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,"
p2763
ag11
aS'No one there...'
p2764
aS'This place is haunted!'
p2765
aS"It's not,"
p2766
aS'The Shrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.'
p2767
aS"That's where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf, None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if I hadn't been so foolhardy..."
p2768
aS"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform.... I'm able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.\n"
p2769
aS"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children exposed to me.\n"
p2770
aS'But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I\n'

aS' -- Lupin looked miserably around the room, -- '

p2775
ag11
aS'But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black... Peter Pettigrew... and, of course, your father, Harry -- James Potter.'
p2776
aS'Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her... I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth....'
p2777
aS"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me\n"
p2778
ag1805
aS' said Harry, astounded.\n'
p2779
aS'Yes, indeed,'
p2780
aS'It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.'
p2781
aS'But how did that help you?'
p2782
aS"They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,"
p2783
aS"A werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak. They transformed... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the\n"
p2784
ag11
aS'Hurry up, Remus,'
p2785
aS"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there... well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did.... And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James\n"
p2786
ag11
aS"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?"
p2787
aS'A thought that still haunts me,'
p2788
aS'And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness.'
p2789
ag11
aS"All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others along with me... and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along."
p2790
aS'Snape?'
p2791

aS'I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,'

aS"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies... and to deliver the last Potter to them. if he gave them Harry, who'd dare say he'd betrayed Lord Voldemort? He'd be welcomed back with honors....\n"

aS'So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive....'

p2937
aS'Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,'
p2938
aS"I assume that's why you didn't tell me, Sirius?"
p2939
aS'Forgive me, Remus,'
p2940
aS'Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,'
p2941
aS'And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were the spy?'

aS'Of course,'

aS"Ah, well, Snape... Harry Potter, you know... we've all got a bit of a blind spot where he's concerned."
p3035
aS'And yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment? Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other student would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading his friends into such danger. Consider, Minister -- against all school rules -- after all the precautions put in place for his protection -- out-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer -- and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too --'
p3036
aS'Well, well... we shall see, Snape, we shall see.... The boy has undoubtedly been foolish....'
p3037
aS"What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors... you've really no idea what made them retreat, Snape?"
p3038
aS"No, Minister... by the time I had come 'round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances...."
p3039
aS'Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl --'

p3058

p3060
aS'My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss Granger,'
p3061
aS'I have just been talking to Sirius Black --'
p3062
aS"I suppose he's told you the same fairy tale he's planted in Potter's mind?"
p3063
aS'Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive --'
p3064
aS"That, indeed, is Black's story,"
p3065
aS'And does my evidence count for nothing?'
p3066
aS'Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds.'
p3067

aS'Now, Snape,'

aS'They need treatment, they need rest --'
p3076
aS'This cannot wait,'
p3077
aS'I must insist.'
p3078
aS'The dementors should have arrived by now,'
p3079
aS"I'll go and meet them. Dumbledore, I'll see you upstairs."
p3080
aS"You surely don't believe a word of Black's story?"
p3081
aS'I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,'
p3082
aS'Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,'
p3083
aS"You haven't forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven't forgotten that he once tried to kill me?"
p3084
aS'My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,'
p3085
aS"Professor, Black's telling the truth -- we saw Pettigrew "
p3086
ag11
aS"-- he's a rat --"
p3087
aS"-- Pettigrew's front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off --"

p3094
aS'He hates Sirius,'
p3095
aS'All because of some stupid trick Sirius played on him --'
p3096
aS"Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady -- entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife -- without Pettigrew, alive or dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius's sentence."
p3097

p3116

p3117
aS"Footsteps across the hall... yes, I think it's us going down to Hagrid's!"
p3118
aS'Yes,'
p3119
aS"I'm sure it's us. It doesn't sound like more than three people... and we're walking slowly because we're under the Invisibility Cloak -- "
p3120
aS"We've gone down the front steps...."
p3121
aS'Where did you get that hourglass thing?'
p3122
aS"It's called a Time-Turner,"
p3123
aS"and I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I've been using it all year\n"
p3124
aS"Harry, I don't understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he tell us to go back three hours? How's that going to help Sirius?"
p3125
aS'There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change,'
p3126
aS"What happened? We were walking down to Hagrid's three hours ago...."
p3127
aS"This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid's,"

p3129
aS'Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent life....'
p3130
aS"Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!"
p3131
aS'But -- how will that help Sirius?'
p3132
aS"Dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of Flitwick's office! Where they've got Sirius locked up! We've got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak -- they can escape together!"
p3133
aS"Well, we've got to try, haven't we?"
p3134
aS"Doesn't sound like anyone's there.... Come on, let's go."
p3135
aS"If anyone's looking out of the window --"
p3136
aS"Okay, but we'll go around by the greenhouses!"
p3137
aS"We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid's front door, or we'll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid's by now!"
p3138
aS'Right,'
p3139
aS"We need to sneak over to Hagrid's.... Keep out of sight, Harry...."
p3140
aS"It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can take it off."
p3141
aS"Yeh shouldn've come!"
p3142
aS"Let's move along a bit,"
p3143
aS'We need to get nearer to Buckbeak!'
p3144
aS'No!'
p3145
aS"If we steal him now, those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free! We've got to wait until they've seen he's\n"
p3146

aS"That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug,"
p3148
aS"I'm going to find Scabbers in a moment --"
p3149
aS'No!'
p3150
aS"Don't you understand? We're breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --"
p3151
aS"We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!"
p3152
aS"Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid's house?"
p3153
aS"I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad,"
p3154
aS"or I'd think there was some Dark Magic going on --"
p3155
aS"Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time.... Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake!"
p3156
aS'Okay!'
p3157
aS'It was just an idea, I just thought\n'
p3158

aS"Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!"
p3165
aS"Go quick. Don' listen...."
p3166
aS'Where is the beast?'
p3167
aS'Out -- outside,'
p3168
aS"We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --"
p3169
aS'It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown --'
p3170
aS"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the Committee's appointed executioner, Walden Macnai..."
p3171
aS'... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here...'
p3172
aS"Well, let's get this over with,"
p3173
aS'Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if you stay inside --'
p3174
aS"No, I -- I wan' ter be with him.... I don' wan' him ter be alone --"
p3175
aS'Harry, hurry!'
p3176
aS'Stop!'
p3177
aS'They might hear us\n'
p3178
aS'Where is it?'
p3179
aS'Where is the beast?'
p3180
aS'It was tied here!'
p3181
ag11
aS'How extraordinary,'
p3182
aS'Beaky!'
p3183
aS"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!"
p3184
aS'Someone untied him!'
p3185
aS'We should search the grounds, the forest.'
p3186
aS'Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot?'
p3187
aS'Search the skies, if you will.... Hagrid, I could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.'
p3188
aS"O' -- o' course, Professor,"
p3189
aS'Come in, come in....'
p3190
aS'Now what?'
p3191
aS"We'll have to hide in here,"
p3192
aS"We need to wait until they've gone back to the castle. Then we wait until\n"
p3193
ag11
aS"We're going to have to move,"
p3194
aS"We've got to be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won't know what's going on."
p3195
aS'Okay,'
p3196
aS"But we've got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember...."
p3197
aS'Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --'
p3198
aS'Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --'
p3199
aS'That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,'
p3200
aS"Right after we'd gone down into the passage!"
p3201
aS'If only Dumbledore had come with us...'
p3202
aS"If he'd only grabbed the cloak,"
p3203
aS"It's just lying there...."
p3204
aS"If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape'd never be able to get it and --"
p3205
aS"Harry, we mustn't be seen!"
p3206
aS'How can you stand this?'
p3207
aS'Just standing here and watching it happen?'
p3208
aS"I'm going to grab the cloak!"
p3209
aS'Harry, no!'
p3210
aS'See?'
p3211
aS"See what would have happened? We've got to keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!"
p3212
aS"So that's it,"
p3213
aS"We're all down there... and now we've just got to wait until we come back up again...."
p3214
aS"Harry, there's something I don't understand.... Why didn't the\n"
p3215
ag11
aS'But what was it?'
p3216
aS"There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,"
p3217
aS'A real Patronus. A powerful one.'
p3218
aS'But who conjured it?'
p3219
aS"Didn't you see what they looked like?"
p3220
aS'Was it one of the teachers?'
p3221
aS'No,'
p3222
aS"He wasn't a teacher."
p3223
aS"But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it light him up? Couldn't you see --?"
p3224
aS'Who did you think it was?'
p3225
aS' Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to sound. I think it was my dad.'
p3226
aS'You think you saw his ghost?'
p3227
aS"I don't know... no... he looked solid...."
p3228
aS'But then --'
p3229
aS'Maybe I was seeing things,'
p3230
aS"But... from what I could see... it looked like him.... I've got photos of him...."
p3231
aS' said Harry flatly. He turned to took at\n'
p3232
aS'Here we come!'
p3233
aS'Harry,'
p3234
aS"we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we can do...."
p3235
aS"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry\n"
p3236
aS'How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?'
p3237
aS"There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're not supposed to be doing anything else!"
p3238
aS'All right!'
p3239
aS'There goes Lupin,'
p3240
aS"He's transforming "
p3241
aS' said Harry suddenly. '
p3242
ag11
aS"We mustn't, I keep telling you --"
p3243
aS"Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!"
p3244
aS'Quick!'
p3245
aS'Quick! Where are we going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming any moment --'
p3246
aS"Shh, Fang, it's us!"
p3247
aS'That was really close!'
p3248
aS'Yeah...'
p3249
aS"Well... okay, then... I'll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be careful -- there's a werewolf out there -- and the dementors\n"
p3250
aS'Come on!'
p3251
aS'Where are you? Dad, come on --'
p3252
aS'What did you do?'
p3253
aS'You said you were only going to keep a lookout!'
p3254
aS'I just saved all our lives...,'
p3255
aS"Get behind here -- behind this bush -- I'll explain."
p3256
aS'Did anyone see you?'
p3257
aS"Yes, haven't you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad! It's okay!"
p3258
aS"Harry, I can't believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic. I knew I could do it this time,"
p3259
aS"because I'd already done it....\n"
p3260
ag11
aS"I don't know -- Harry, look at Snape!"
p3261
aS"Right, it's nearly time,"
p3262
aS"We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. We've got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we're missing.... 11\n"
p3263
aS"D' you reckon he's up there yet?"
p3264
aS'Look!'
p3265
aS"\\Who's that? Someone's coming back out of the castle!"
p3266
aS'Macnair!'
p3267
aS"The executioner! He's gone to get the dementors! This is it, Hermione --"
p3268
aS'Ready?'
p3269
aS"YotM better hold on to me -- He nudged Buckbeak's sides with his heels.\n"
p3270
ag11
aS'Whoa!'
p3271
aS'Stand back!'
p3272
aS'Alohomora!'
p3273
aS'How -- how --?'
p3274
aS"Get on -- there's not much time,"
p3275
aS"You've got to get out of here -the dementors are coming -- Macnair's gone to get them."
p3276
aS'Okay, Buckbeak, up!'
p3277
aS'Up to the tower -- come on.\n'
p3278
aS'What happened to the other boy? Ron?'
p3279
aS"He's going to be okay. He's still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says\n"
p3280
ag11
aS'How can I ever thank --'
p3281
aS"We'll see each other again,"
p3282
aS"You are -- truly your father's son, Harry...."
p3283
ag11
aS"We've got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us -- before Dumbledore locks the door --"
p3284
aS'Okay,'
p3285
aS"let's go...."
p3286
aS"... only hope Dumbledore's not going to make difficulties,"
p3287
aS'The Kiss will be performed immediately?'
p3288
aS"As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we've got him at last.... I daresay they'll want to interview you, Snape... and once young Harry's back in his right mind, I expect he'll want to tell the Prophet exactly\n"
p3289
ag11
aS"Oh, he's horrible,"
p3290
aS"I bet he's all excited because the dementors are going to finish off Sirius...."
p3291
aS'Three minutes, Harry!'
p3292
aS' Hermione moaned, checking her watch again. '
p3293
ag11
aS'Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore,'
p3294
aS'Come on, Harry!'
p3295
aS'I am going to lock you in,'
p3296
aS'it is five minutes\n'
p3297
ag11
aS'Well done. I think --'
p3298
aS"Yes, I think you've gone too -- get inside -- I'll lock you in --"
p3299
aS'Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my patients now?'
p3300
aS'What was that?'
p3301
aS"Really -- they'll wake everybody up! What do they think they're doing?"
p3302
aS'He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the room with him. When this gets out --'
p3303
aS"HE DIDN'T DISAPPARATE!"
p3304
aS"YOU CAN'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS -- HAS --\n"
p3305
aS'Severus -- be reasonable -- Harry has been locked up --'
p3306
aS'OUT WITH IT, POTTER!'
p3307
aS'WHAT DID YOU DO?'
p3308
aS'Professor Snape!'
p3309
aS'Control yourself!'
p3310
aS'See here, Snape, be reasonable,'
p3311
aS"This door's been locked, we just saw --"
p3312
aS'Calm down, man!'
p3313
aS"You're talking nonsense!"
p3314
aS"YOU DON'T KNOW POTTER!"
p3315
aS'HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT\n'
p3316
ag11
aS'That will do, Severus,'
p3317
aS'Think about what you are saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?'
p3318
aS'Of course not!'
p3319
aS'I would have heard them!'
p3320
aS'Well, there you have it, Severus,'
p3321
aS"Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further."
p3322
aS'Fellow seems quite unbalanced,'
p3323
aS"I'd watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore."
p3324
aS"Oh, he's not unbalanced,"
p3325
aS"He's just suffered a severe disappointment."
p3326
aS"He's not the only one!"
p3327
aS"The Daily Prophet's going to have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that\n"
p3328
aS'And the dementors?'
p3329
aS"They'll be removed from the school, I trust?"
p3330
aS"Oh yes, they'll have to go,"
p3331
aS"Never dreamed they'd attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy... Completely out of control... no, I'll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight.... Perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance...."
p3332
aS'What -- what happened?'
p3333
aS"Harry? Why are we in here? Where's Sirius? Where's Lupin? What's going on?"
p3334
aS'You explain,'
p3335
aS"Know I shouldn' feel happy, after wha' happened las' night,"
p3336
aS"I mean, Black escapin' again, an, everythin' -- but guess what?"
p3337
aS'What?'
p3338
aS"Beaky! He escaped! He's free! Bin celebratin' all night!"
p3339
aS"Yeah... can't've tied him up properly,"
p3340
aS"I was worried this mornin', mind... thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin' las' night...."
p3341
aS"Blimey, haven' yeh heard?"
p3342
aS"Er -- Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin'.... Thought everyone'd know by now... Professor Lupin's a werewolf, see. An' he was loose on the grounds las' night.... He's packin' now, o' course.\n"
p3343
aS"He's packing?"
p3344
aS'Why?'
p3345
aS"But if he's resigned --"
p3346
aS"-- doesn't sound like there's anything we can do --"
p3347
aS"I don't care. I still want to see him. I'll meet you back here."
p3348
aS'I saw you coming,'
p3349
aS'I just saw Hagrid,'
p3350
aS"And he said you'd resigned. It's not true, is it?"
p3351
aS"I'm afraid it is,"
p3352
aS'Why?'
p3353
aS"The Ministry of Magic don't think you were helping Sirius, do they?"
p3354
aS'No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to save your lives.'
p3355
aS'That was the final straw for Severus. I\n'
p3356
ag11
aS"You're not leaving just because of that!"
p3357
aS'This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents.... They will not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you.... That must never happen again.'
p3358
aS"You're the best Defense Against the Dark Arts- teacher we've ever had!"
p3359
aS"Don't go!"
p3360
aS"How d'you know about that?"
p3361
aS'What else could have driven the dementors back?'
p3362
aS'Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed,'
p3363
aS"You guessed right... that's why we called him Prongs."
p3364
aS'Here -- I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night,'
p3365
aS"You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would've wanted to lure me out of school... you said they'd have thought it was funny."
p3366
aS'And so we would have,'
p3367
aS'I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out\n'
p3368
ag11
aS'Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,'
p3369
aS'Thank You, Headmaster.'
p3370
aS'Well -- good-bye, Harry,'
p3371
aS"It has been a real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage...."
p3372
aS'Why so miserable, Harry?'
p3373
aS'You should be very proud of yourself after last night.'
p3374
aS"Didn't make any difference?"
p3375
aS'It made all the difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.'
p3376
aS'Professor Dumbledore -- yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very -- very strange.'
p3377
aS'Indeed?'
p3378
aS'Er -- stranger than usual, you mean?'
p3379
aS'Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been.'
p3380
aS"Who'd have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise...."
p3381
aS'But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew! That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!'
p3382
aS'It does not,'
p3383
aS"Hasn't your experience with the\n"
p3384
ag11
aS'But if he helps Voldemort back to power\n'
p3385
aS"Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt.... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates\n"
p3386
aS"I don't want a connection with Pettigrew!"
p3387
aS'He betrayed my parents!'
p3388
aS'This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust\n'
p3389
ag11
aS'I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,'
p3390
aS'He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.'
p3391
aS"I thought it was my dad who'd conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him."
p3392
aS'An easy mistake\n'
p3393
aS' said Dumbledore softly. '
p3394
aS'It was stupid, thinking it was him,'
p3395
aS'I mean, I knew he was dead.'
p3396
aS"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night."
p3397
aS' said Dumbledore, smiling. '
p3398
ag11
aS"If I manage to get into the Ministry, I'll have a lot of proposals to\n"
p3399
aS' he told the only person who would listen -- his girlfriend, Penelope.\n'
p3400
aS"Wonder what they'll give us next year?"
p3401
aS'Maybe a vampire,'
p3402
aS"I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast. I've decided to drop Muggle Studies."
p3403
aS'But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!'
p3404
aS'I know,'
p3405
aS"but I can't stand another year like this\n"
p3406
ag11
aS' said Ron grumpily. '
p3407
ag11
aS"I promised I wouldn't tell anyone,"
p3408
aS'Oh, cheer up, Harry!'
p3409
aS"Yeah, I've been thinking about them too,"
p3410
aS"Harry, you've got to come and stay with us. I'll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I'll\n"
p3411
ag11
aS'A telephone, Ron,'
p3412
aS'Honestly, you should take Muggle Studies next year....'
p3413
aS"It's the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come and stay, and we'll go and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work."
p3414
aS"Yeah... I bet the Dursleys'd be pleased to let me come... especially after what I did to Aunt Marge...."
p3415
aS'Harry,'
p3416
aS"What's that thing outside your window?"
p3417
aS'Ha!'
p3418
aS'See! I told you it was from him!'
p3419
aS"Yes, but he hadn't jinxed it, had he?"
p3420
aS'Ouch!'
p3421
aS'Keep him?'
p3422
ag11
aS'Little tyke,'
p3423
aS"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry"
p3424
aS'Sorry,'
p3425
aS"Don't be sorry, my dear sir,\n"
p3426
ag11
aS'Shoo!'
p3427
aS"Won't!"
p3428
aS"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's\n"
p3429
aS' The newscaster allowed himself a grin. '
p3430
ag11
aS'Well, Ted,'
p3431
aS"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's\n"
p3432
ag11
aS"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?"
p3433
aS'No,'
p3434
aS'Why?'
p3435
aS'Funny stuff on the news,'
p3436
aS'Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...'
p3437
aS'So?'
p3438
aS'Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.'
p3439
aS'Potter.'
p3440
aS'Their son --\n'
p3441
ag11
aS'I suppose so,'
p3442
aS"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"
p3443
aS'Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.'
p3444
aS'Oh, yes,'
p3445
aS'Yes, I quite agree.'
p3446
aS'I should have known.'
p3447
aS'Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.'
p3448
aS'How did you know it was me?'
p3449
aS"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."
p3450
aS"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,"
p3451
aS'All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.'
p3452
aS"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,"
p3453
aS"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news."
p3454
aS"I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."
p3455
aS"You can't blame them,"
p3456
aS"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years."
p3457
aS'I know that,'
p3458
aS"But that's no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors."
p3459
aS'A\n'
p3460
ag11
aS'It certainly seems so,'
p3461
aS'We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?'
p3462
aS'A what?'
p3463
aS"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of"
p3464
aS'No, thank you,'
p3465
aS'As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -'
p3466
aS'My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him\n'
p3467
aS' Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. '
p3468
aS"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. "
p3469
ag11
aS'You flatter me,'
p3470
aS'Voldemort had powers I will never have.'
p3471
aS"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."
p3472
aS"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs."
p3473
aS"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?"
p3474
aS'everyone'
p3475
aS"What they're saying,"
p3476
aS"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. "
p3477
aS"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it... Oh, Albus..."
p3478
aS'I know... I know...'
p3479
aS"That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.\n"
p3480
aS"It's -- it's true?"
p3481
aS"After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?\n"
p3482
aS'We can only guess,'
p3483
aS'We may never know.'
p3484
aS"Hagrid's late. I suppose it was\n"
p3485
ag11
aS'Yes,'
p3486
aS"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?"
p3487
aS"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now."
p3488
aS"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?"
p3489
aS"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!"
p3490
aS"It's the best place for him,"
p3491
aS"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter."
p3492
aS'A letter?'
p3493
aS"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child\n"
p3494
ag11
aS'Exactly,'
p3495
aS"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?"
p3496
aS"Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy\n"
p3497
aS' She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\n'
p3498
aS"Hagrid's bringing him."
p3499
aS'You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?'
p3500
aS' said Dumbledore.\n'
p3501
aS"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,"
p3502
aS"but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?"
p3503
aS'Hagrid,'
p3504
aS'At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?'
p3505
aS'Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,'
p3506
aS"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir."
p3507
aS'No problems, were there?'
p3508
aS"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol."
p3509
aS'Is that where -?'
p3510
aS'Yes,'
p3511
aS"He'll have that scar forever."
p3512
aS"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"
p3513
aS"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with."
p3514
aS'Shhh!'
p3515
aS"you'll wake the Muggles!"
p3516
aS'S-s-sorry,'
p3517
aS"But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead\n"
p3518
aS"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or\n"
p3519
aS' Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out\n'
p3520
aS'Well,'
p3521
aS"that's that. We've no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."
p3522
aS'Yeah,'
p3523
aS"I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."
p3524
aS'I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,'
p3525
aS'Good luck, Harry,'
p3526
aS'Up! Get up! Now!'
p3527
aS'Are you up yet?'
p3528
aS'Nearly,'
p3529
aS"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday."
p3530
aS'What did you say?'
p3531
aS'Nothing, nothing...'
p3532
aS'In the car crash when your parents died,'
p3533
aS"And don't ask questions."
p3534
aS'Thirty-six,'
p3535
aS"That's two less than last year."
p3536
aS"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy."
p3537
aS'All right, thirty-seven then,'
p3538
aS"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''\n"
p3539
aS"So I'll have thirty ... thirty..."
p3540
aS'Thirty-nine, sweetums,'
p3541
aS'Oh.'
p3542
aS'All right then.'
p3543
aS"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!"
p3544
aS'Bad news, Vernon,'
p3545
aS"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him."
p3546
aS'We could phone Marge,'
p3547

aS'No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,'
p3616
aS'I have burned it.'
p3617
aS'SILENCE!'
p3618
aS"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.\n"
p3619
aS'Why?'
p3620
aS"Don't ask questions!"
p3621

p3625
aS' he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\n'
p3626
aS'See,'
p3627
aS"if they can't deliver them they'll just give up."
p3628
aS"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon."

p3638
ag11
aS"I'll take them,"
p3639
aS" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n"

p3670
aS'Sony?'
p3671
aS"It' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?"
p3672
aS'All what?'
p3673
aS'ALL WHAT?'
p3674
aS"Now wait jus' one second!"
p3675

p3694
aS"A wizard, o' course,"
p3695
aS"an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter."

ag11
aS"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...."

aS"It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows --"
p3718
aS'Who? '
p3719
aS"Well -- I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does."
p3720
aS'Why not?'
p3721
aS"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was..."
p3722
aS"Nah -can't spell it. All right -- Voldemort. "
p3723
aS"Don'\n"
p3724
aS"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the\n"
p3725
aS"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an' -- an' --"

aS'Sorry,'
p3727
aS"But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..."
p3728
aS"You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't\n"
p3729
ag11
aS"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought yeh ter this lot..."
p3730
aS'Now, you listen here, boy,'
p3731
aS"I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --"
p3732
aS"I'm warning you, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more word... "
p3733
aS"That's better,"
p3734
aS'But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?'
p3735
aS"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see... he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go?\n"
p3736
aS"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his\n"
p3737
aS"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on -- I dunno what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all right."

aS'Hagrid,'

aS'See?'

p3755

aS"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,"
p3857
aS'Might as well get yer uniform,'
p3858
aS'Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I\n'
p3859
aS" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.\n"
p3860
aS'Hello,'
p3861
aS'Hogwarts, too?'
p3862
aS'Yes,'
p3863
aS"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands,"
p3864
aS"Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting\n"

ag11
aS'Have you got your own broom?'
p3866
aS'No,'
p3867
aS'Play Quidditch at all?'
p3868
aS"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?"
p3869
aS'No,'
p3870
aS'Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know\n'
p3871
ag1805
aS' said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\n'

aS"That's Hagrid,"
p3873

p3874
aS'Oh,'
p3875
aS"I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?"
p3876
aS"He's the gamekeeper,"
p3877
aS"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the\n"

ag11
aS'Do you?'
p3879
aS'Why is he with you? Where are your parents?'
p3880
aS'Oh, sorry,'
p3881
aS"But they were our kind, weren't they?"
p3882
aS"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean."
p3883
aS"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're\n"
p3884
ag11
aS"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,"
p3885
aS"What's up?"
p3886
aS"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin' about Quidditch!"
p3887
aS"Don't make me feel worse,"
p3888
aS"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in."
p3889
aS"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones\n"
p3890
ag11
aS'So what is Quidditch?'
p3891
aS"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules."
p3892
aS'And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?'
p3893
aS"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but --"
p3894
aS'Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,'
p3895
aS"There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one."
p3896
aS'Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?'
p3897
aS"Years an' years ago,"
p3898
aS'I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.'
p3899
aS"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,"
p3900
aS"An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level."
p3901
aS"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday present."
p3902
aS"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want\n"
p3903
ag11
aS"Don' mention it,"
p3904
aS"Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand."
p3905
aS'Ah yes,'
p3906
aS"Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter."
p3907
aS"You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work."
p3908
aS'Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I\n'
p3909
ag11
aS"And that's where..."
p3910
aS"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,"
p3911
aS"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do...."
p3912
aS"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?"
p3913
aS'It was, sir, yes,'
p3914
aS'Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?'
p3915
aS'Er -- yes, they did, yes,'
p3916
aS"I've still got the pieces, though,"
p3917
aS"But you don't use them?"
p3918
aS'Hmmm,'
p3919
aS'Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see.'
p3920
aS'Which is your wand arm?'
p3921
aS"Er -- well, I'm right-handed,"
p3922
aS'That will do,'
p3923
aS'Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.'
p3924
aS'Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --'
p3925
aS'No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.'
p3926
aS"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."
p3927
aS'Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... '
p3928
aS'Curious... curious..\n'
p3929
aS'Sorry,'
p3930
aS"but what's curious?"
p3931
aS"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar."
p3932
aS'Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great.'
p3933
aS'Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,'
p3934
aS'You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,'
p3935
aS"Everyone thinks I'm special,"
p3936
aS"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died."
p3937
aS"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact."

aS'Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, '
p3939
aS"First o' September -- King's Cross -- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon, Harry."
p3940
aS'Er -- Uncle Vernon?'
p3941
aS"Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts."
p3942
aS'Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?'
p3943
aS'Thank you.'
p3944
aS"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?"
p3945
aS"I don't know,"
p3946
aS"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock,"
p3947
aS'Platform what?'
p3948
aS'Nine and three-quarters.'
p3949
aS"Don't talk rubbish,"
p3950
aS'There is no platform nine and three-quarters.'
p3951
aS"It's on my ticket."
p3952
aS'Barking,'
p3953
aS"howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see. You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother."
p3954
aS'Taking Dudley to the hospital,'
p3955
aS'Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.'
p3956
aS"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?"
p3957
aS'-- packed with Muggles, of course --'
p3958
aS"Now, what's the platform number?"
p3959
aS'Nine and three-quarters!'
p3960
aS"Mom, can't I go... "
p3961
aS"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go\n"
p3962
ag11
aS'Fred, you next,'
p3963
aS"I'm not Fred, I'm George,"
p3964

p3965
aS'Sorry, George, dear.'
p3966
aS'Only joking, I am Fred,'
p3967
aS'Hello, dear,'
p3968
aS"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too."
p3969
aS'Yes,'
p3970
aS"The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to --"
p3971
aS'Not to worry,'
p3972
aS"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a\n"
p3973
ag11
aS'Er -- okay,'
p3974
aS'Oh, Neville,'
p3975
aS'Give us a look, Lee, go on.'
p3976
aS'Want a hand?'
p3977
aS"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!"
p3978
aS'Thanks,'
p3979
aS"What's that?"
p3980
aS'Blimey,'
p3981

p3982
aS'He is,'

aS"Aren't you?"
p3984
aS'What?'
p3985
aS'Harry Potter, '
p3986
aS'Oh, him,'
p3987
aS'I mean, yes, I am.'
p3988
aS'Fred? George? Are you there?'
p3989
aS'Coming, Mom.'
p3990
aS"Ron, you've got something on your nose."
p3991
aS'Mom -- geroff'
p3992
aS'Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?'
p3993
aS'Shut up,'
p3994
aS"Where's Percy?"
p3995
aS"He's coming now."
p3996
aS"Can't stay long, Mother,"
p3997
aS"I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves --"
p3998
aS'Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?'
p3999
aS'You should have said something, we had no idea.'
p4000
aS'Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,'
p4001
aS'Once --'
p4002
aS'Or twice --'
p4003
aS'A minute --'
p4004
aS'All summer --'
p4005
aS'Oh, shut up,'
p4006
aS'How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?'
p4007
aS"Because he's a prefect,"
p4008
aS'All right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there.'
p4009
aS"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --"
p4010
aS"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet."
p4011
aS'Great idea though, thanks, Mom.'
p4012
aS"It's not funny. And look after Ron."
p4013
aS"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us."
p4014
aS'You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?'
p4015
aS'Who?'
p4016
aS'Harry Potter!'
p4017
aS'Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....'
p4018
aS"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?"
p4019
aS"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning."
p4020
aS'Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.'
p4021
aS'Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?'
p4022
aS"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school."
p4023
aS'All right, keep your hair on.'
p4024
aS'Hurry up!'
p4025
aS"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls."
p4026
aS"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat."
p4027
aS'George!'
p4028
aS'Only joking, Mom.'
p4029
aS'Anyone sitting there?'
p4030
aS'Everywhere else is full.'
p4031
aS'Hey, Ron.'
p4032
aS"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there."
p4033
aS'Right,'
p4034
aS'Harry,'
p4035
aS'did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\n'
p4036
aS"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes,"
p4037
aS'And have you really got -- you know...'
p4038
aS'Yes,'
p4039
aS"but I can't remember it."
p4040
aS'Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.'
p4041
aS'Er -- Yes, I think so,'
p4042
aS"I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."
p4043
aS'So you must know loads of magic already.'
p4044
aS'I heard you went to live with Muggles,'
p4045
aS'What are they like?'
p4046
aS"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers."
p4047
aS'Five,'
p4048
aS"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,\n"
p4049
ag11
aS"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."
p4050
aS"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort"
p4051
aS"You said You-Know-Who's name!"
p4052
aS"I'd have thought you, of all people --"
p4053
aS"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,"
p4054
aS' he added, voicing for the first time something that\n'
p4055
aS"I bet I'm the worst in the class."
p4056
aS"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough."
p4057
aS'Anything off the cart, dears?'
p4058
aS'Hungry, are you?'
p4059
aS'Starving,'
p4060
aS'Swap you for one of these,'

p4062
aS"You don't want this, it's all dry,"
p4063
aS"She hasn't got much time,"
p4064
aS'you know, with five of us.'
p4065
aS'Go on, have a pasty,'
p4066
aS'No,'
p4067
aS"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa."
p4068
aS'What?'
p4069
aS"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy."
p4070
aS'So this is Dumbledore!'
p4071
aS"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!"
p4072
aS'Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks\n'
p4073
aS"He's gone!"
p4074
aS"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,"
p4075
aS"He'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting."
p4076
aS'Help yourself,'
p4077
aS'But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.'
p4078
aS'Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts.'
p4079
aS'Sorry,'
p4080
aS'but have you seen a toad at all?'
p4081

p4082
ag11
aS"He'll turn up,"
p4083
aS'Yes,'
p4084
aS'Well, if you see him...'
p4085
aS"Don't know why he's so bothered,"
p4086
aS"If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk."
p4087
aS"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway\n"
p4088
aS"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,"
p4089
aS"We've already told him we haven't seen it,"
p4090
aS'Er -- all right.'
p4091
aS'Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.'
p4092
aS"Are you sure that's a real spell?"
p4093
aS"Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's\n"
p4094
aS'Are you really?'
p4095
aS"I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\n"
p4096
aS'Am I?'
p4097
aS"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,"
p4098
aS"Do either of you know what house you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far\n"
p4099

aS"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,"
p4100
aS'Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.'
p4101
aS'What house are your brothers in?'
p4102
aS'Gryffindor,'
p4103
aS"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I\n"
p4104

p4105
aS'Yeah,'
p4106
aS"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,"
p4107
aS"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?"
p4108
aS"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts,"
p4109
aS'Did you hear about\n'
p4110
ag11
aS'Really? What happened to them?'
p4111
aS"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it."
p4112
aS'Voldemort'
p4113
aS" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\n"
p4114
aS'Is it true?'
p4115
aS"They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?"
p4116
aS'Yes,'
p4117
aS'Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,'
p4118
aS"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford."
p4119
aS"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
p4120
aS'I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,'
p4121
aS"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,"
p4122
aS"Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the\n"
p4123
ag11
aS"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?"
p4124
aS'Unless you get out now,'
p4125
aS"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some."
p4126
aS' Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. '
p4127
ag11
aS"You've met Malfoy before?"
p4128
aS"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!"
p4129
aS'Scabbers has been fighting, not us,'
p4130
aS'Would you mind leaving while we change?'
p4131
aS'All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,'
p4132
aS"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?"

aS'The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses.

You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\n'
p4148
aS'The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n'
p4149
aS'The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as\n'

aS'Please wait quietly.'
p4152
aS'How exactly do they sort us into houses?'

aS'Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --'

aS'Welcome,'
p4192
aS'Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\n'

aS'Is he -- a bit mad?'
p4195
aS'Mad?'
p4196
aS"He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?"

aS"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost."

p4204
aS"I've never asked,"
p4205
ag11
aS"I'm half-and-half,"
p4206
aS"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him."

aS'What about you, Neville?'
p4208
aS"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,"
p4209
aS'but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might\n'

p4211
aS"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
p4212
aS"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape."
p4213
aS'Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\n'
p4214
aS'First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.'
p4215
aS'I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n'
p4216
aS'Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n'

ag11
aS'Must be,'
p4219

p4255

aS'And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.'
p4263
aS'Idiot boy!'
p4264
aS'I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?'
p4265
aS"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor."
p4266
aS'Doi* push it,'
p4267
aS"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty."
p4268
aS'Cheer up,'
p4269
aS"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?"
p4270
aS'Hang on,'

aS'Back, Fang.'
p4272
aS'Another Weasley, eh?'
p4273
ag11
aS"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it."

aS'Why should he?'

aS'Did you see his face, the great lump?'
p4300

p4320
aS'Are you serious, Professor?'
p4321
aS'Absolutely,'
p4322
aS"The boy's a natural. I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?"
p4323
aS'He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,'
p4324
aS"Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it."

aS'Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?'
p4326
aS"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,"
p4327
ag11
ag11

p4328
aS'Your father would have been proud,'
p4329
aS'He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.'
p4330
aS"You're joking."
p4331
aS'Seeker?'
p4332
aS'But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. '
p4333
ag11
aS'I start training next week,'
p4334
aS"Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret."
p4335
aS'Well done,'
p4336
aS"Wood told us. We're on the team too -- Beaters."

p4339
ag11
aS"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school."
p4340
aS"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you."
p4341
aS'Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?'
p4342
aS"I'd take you on anytime on my own,"
p4343
aS"Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only -- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?"
p4344
aS'Of course he has,'
p4345
aS"I'm his second, who's yours?"
p4346
aS'Crabbe,'
p4347
aS"Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked."
p4348
aS"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway."
p4349
aS'And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?'
p4350
aS"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?"
p4351
aS"--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's really very selfish of you."
p4352
aS"And it's really none of your business,"
p4353
aS'Good-bye,'
p4354
aS"I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry."

p4360
aS"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so --"
p4361
aS'Now what am I going to do?'
p4362
aS"That's your problem,"
p4363

p4368
aS"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed."
p4369

p4370
aS"How's your arm?"
p4371
aS'Fine,'
p4372
aS'Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.'
p4373
aS"Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later --"
p4374
aS"Don't leave me!"
p4375
aS"I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already."
p4376
aS"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\n"
p4377
aS'Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.'
p4378
aS"They're in here somewhere,"
p4379
aS'probably hiding.'

p4386
aS"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out."
p4387
aS"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty."

aS"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please."
p4389
aS'Should tell Filch, I should,'

aS"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?"
p4405
aS"Didn't you see what it was standing on.\n"
p4406
aS"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something."
p4407
ag11

p4415
aS'A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,'
p4416
aS"And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've got it,"
p4417
aS"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?"
p4418
aS"I thought you weren't speaking to us?"
p4419
aS"Yes, don't stop now,"
p4420
aS"it's doing us so much good."
p4421
aS"Hey, Potter, come down!'\n"
p4422
aS'Very nice,'
p4423
aS"I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week."
p4424
aS'Right,'
p4425
aS"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.\n"

p4429
aS'Three Chasers, one Keeper,'
p4430
aS'And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\n'

aS' growled Professor McGonagall.\n'
p4538
aS"I mean, after that open and revolting foul 'Jordan, I'm warning you --"
p4539
aS"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession."

p4544
aS"Can't have,"
p4545

p4546
aS'What are you doing?'
p4547
aS'I knew it,'
p4548
aS'Snape -- look.'
p4549
aS"He's doing something -- jinxing the broom,"
p4550
aS'What should we do?'
p4551
aS'Leave it to me.'
p4552
aS"I've got the Snitch!"
p4553
aS'Rubbish,'
p4554
aS"Why would Snape do somethin' like that?"
p4555
aS'I found out something about him,'
p4556
aS"He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding."

p4559

p4560
aS"Now, don't ask me anymore,"
p4561
aS"That's top secret, that is."
p4562
aS"But Snape's trying to steal it."
p4563
aS'Rubbish,'
p4564
aS"Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort."
p4565
aS'So why did he just try and kill Harry?'
p4566
ag11
aS"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!"
p4567
aS"I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel --"
p4568
aS'Aha!'
p4569
aS"so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?"
p4570
aS'I do feel so sorry,'
p4571
aS'for all\n'
p4572
ag11
aS"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron."
p4573
aS'Would you mind moving out of the way?'
p4574
aS"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to."
p4575
aS'WEASLEY!'
p4576
aS'He was provoked, Professor Snape,'
p4577
aS"Malfoy was insultin' his family."
p4578
aS'Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,'
p4579
aS"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you."
p4580

p4581
aS"one of these days, I'll get him --"
p4582

aS'Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?'
p4587
aS'How many days you got left until yer holidays?'
p4588
aS'Just one,'
p4589
aS"And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."
p4590
aS"Oh yeah, you're right,"
p4591
aS'The library?'
p4592
aS"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?"
p4593
aS'You what?'
p4594
aS"Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'."
p4595
aS"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,"
p4596
aS"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.\n"
p4597
aS'Just have to find out for ourselves, then,'
p4598
aS'What are you looking for, boy?'
p4599
aS'Nothing,'
p4600
aS"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!"
p4601
aS"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?"
p4602
aS'And send me an owl if you find anything.'
p4603
aS'And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,'
p4604
aS"It'd be safe to ask them."
p4605

p4606

aS' On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.\n'
p4608
aS'You, too,'
p4609
aS"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!"
p4610
aS'What did you expect, turnips?'
p4611
aS"That's friendly,"
p4612
aS'Weird!'
p4613
ag11
aS"I think I know who that one's from,"
p4614
aS"My mom. I told her you didn't expect any presents and -- oh, no,"
p4615

p4616
aS'Every year she makes us a sweater,'
p4617
aS"and mine's always maroon."
p4618
aS"That's really nice of her,"
p4619
aS"I've heard of those,"
p4620
aS"If that's what I think it is -- they're really rare, and really valuable."
p4621
aS'What is it?'
p4622
aS"It's an invisibility cloak,"
p4623
aS"I'm sure it is -- try it on."
p4624
aS'It is! Look down!'
p4625
aS"I'd give anything for one of these,"
p4626
aS"Anything. What's the matter?"
p4627
aS'Nothing,'
p4628
aS'Merry Christmas!'
p4629
aS"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!"
p4630
aS"Harry's is better than ours, though,"
p4631
aS"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."
p4632
aS"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?"
p4633
aS"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm."
p4634
aS"You haven't got a letter on yours,"
p4635
aS"I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're called Gred and Forge."
p4636
aS"What's all th is noise.\n"
p4637
aS"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one."
p4638
aS"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n"
p4639
aS"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,"
p4640
aS'Christmas is a time for family.'
p4641
aS"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section."
p4642
aS'Mom?'
p4643
aS'Dad?'
p4644
aS"I'll come back,"
p4645
aS'You could have woken me up,'
p4646
aS"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.\n"
p4647
aS"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone."
p4648
aS'You can see them any old time,'
p4649
aS"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?"
p4650
aS'Are you all right?'
p4651
aS'You look odd.'
p4652
aS"I can't see anything."
p4653
aS'Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them....'
p4654
aS'I can only see you.'
p4655
aS'Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.'
p4656
aS'Look at me!'
p4657
aS'Can you see all your family standing around you?'
p4658
aS"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head boy!"
p4659
aS'What?'
p4660
aS"I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too.\n"
p4661
aS'Do you think this mirror shows the future?'
p4662
aS'How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --'
p4663
aS'You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.'
p4664
aS"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents."
p4665
aS"Don't push me --"
p4666
aS'Quick!'
p4667
aS"This isn't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on."
p4668
aS'Want to play chess, Harry?'
p4669
aS'No.'
p4670
aS"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?"
p4671
aS'No... you go...'
p4672
aS"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight."
p4673
aS'Why not?'
p4674
aS"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?"
p4675
aS'You sound like Hermione.'
p4676
aS"I'm serious, Harry, don't go."
p4677
aS'So -- back again, Harry?'
p4678
aS" -- I didn't see you, sir."
p4679
aS'So,'
p4680
aS'you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.'
p4681
aS"I didn't know it was called that, Sir."
p4682
aS"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?"
p4683
aS'It -- well -- it shows me my family --'
p4684
aS'And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.'
p4685
aS'How did you know --?'
p4686
aS"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,"
p4687
aS'Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?'
p4688
aS'Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?'
p4689
aS'Yes and no,'
p4690
aS'It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us\n'
p4691
aS'The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will\n'
p4692
ag11
aS'Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?'
p4693
aS"Obviously, you've just done so,"
p4694
aS'You may ask me one more thing, however.'
p4695
aS'What do you see when you look in the mirror?'
p4696
aS'One can never have enough socks,'
p4697
aS"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books."
p4698
aS'Will you stop messing around!'
p4699
aS"That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"
p4700
aS"Snape's refereeing?"
p4701
aS"When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin."
p4702
aS"It's not my fault,"
p4703
aS"We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us."
p4704
aS"Don't play,"
p4705
aS"Say you're ill,"
p4706
aS'Pretend to break your leg,'
p4707
aS'Really break your leg,'
p4708
aS"I can't,"
p4709
aS"There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out,\n"
p4710
ag11
aS'Malfoy,'
p4711
aS"I met him outside the library. He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on."
p4712
aS'Go to Professor McGonagall!'
p4713
aS'Report him!'
p4714
aS"I don't want more trouble,"
p4715
aS"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!"
p4716
aS"He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier."
p4717
aS"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that,"
p4718
aS"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?"
p4719
aS'Dumbledore again,'
p4720
aS'He was the first one I ever-'
p4721
aS"I've found him!"
p4722
aS"I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!"
p4723
aS'I never thought to look in here!'
p4724
aS'I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.'
p4725
aS'Light?'
p4726
aS'I knew it! I knew it!'
p4727
aS'Nicolas Flamel,'
p4728
aS"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!"
p4729
aS"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there."
p4730
aS'A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!'
p4731
aS"No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it."
p4732
aS"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,"
p4733
aS"He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?"
p4734
aS"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field,"
p4735
aS"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much."
p4736
aS"The whole school's out there!"
p4737
aS"Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!"
p4738
aS'Dumbledore?'
p4739
aS"I've never seen Snape look so mean,"
p4740
aS"Look -they're off Ouch!"
p4741
aS"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there."
p4742
aS"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?"
p4743
aS'You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?'
p4744
aS"It's people they feel sorry for. See,\n"
p4745
ag11
aS"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy,"
p4746
aS'You tell him, Neville.'
p4747
aS"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something."
p4748
aS"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!"
p4749
aS"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!"
p4750
aS"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus..."
p4751
aS"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private,"
p4752
aS"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all."
p4753
aS"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?"
p4754
aS'B-b-but Severus, I --'
p4755
aS"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,"
p4756
aS"I-I don't know what you\n"
p4757
aS'You know perfectly well what I mean.'
p4758
ag11
aS"B-but I d-d-don't --"
p4759
aS'Very well,'
p4760
aS"We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie."
p4761
aS'Harry, where have you been?'
p4762
ag11
aS"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past\n"
p4763
ag11
aS"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?"
p4764
aS"It'll be gone by next Tuesday,"
p4765
aS'Hermione, the exams are ages away.'
p4766
aS'Ten weeks,'
p4767
aS"That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel."
p4768
aS"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me...."
p4769
ag11
aS"Jus' lookin',"
p4770
aS'Shhhh!'
p4771
aS"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?"
p4772
aS'There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,'
p4773
aS"about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --"
p4774
aS'SHHHH!'
p4775
aS"Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it\n"
p4776
ag11
aS'See you later, then,'
p4777
aS'What was he hiding behind his back?'
p4778
aS'Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?'
p4779
aS"I'm going to see what section he was in,"
p4780
aS'Dragons!'
p4781
aS"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide."
p4782
aS"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, "
p4783
aS"But it's against our laws,"
p4784
aS"Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania."
p4785
aS"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?"
p4786
aS'Of course there are,'
p4787
aS"Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget."
p4788
aS'So what on earths Hagrid up to?'
p4789
aS'Who is it?'
p4790
aS"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?"
p4791
aS'Yes,'
p4792
aS"We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone\n"
p4793
ag11
aS"0' course I cant, he said. "
p4794
ag11
aS'Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,\n'
p4795
aS" said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was\n"
p4796
aS'We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.'
p4797
aS'We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.'
p4798
aS"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments... Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --"
p4799
aS"Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape."
p4800
aS'Snape?'
p4801
aS"Yeah -- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he's not about ter steal it."
p4802
ag11
aS"Hagrid -- what's that?"
p4803
aS'Ah,'
p4804
aS"That's er..."
p4805
aS'Where did you get it, Hagrid?'
p4806
aS"It must've cost you a fortune."
p4807
aS'Won it,'
p4808
aS"Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest."
p4809
aS"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?"
p4810
aS"Well, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. "
p4811
ag11
aS'Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,'
p4812
aS'Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?'
p4813
aS"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing --"
p4814
aS"It's nearly out."
p4815
aS"Isn't he beautiful?"
p4816
aS'Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!'
p4817
aS'Hagrid,'
p4818
aS'how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?'
p4819
aS"What's the matter?"
p4820
aS"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid -- he's runnin' back up ter the school."
p4821
aS"I can't,"
p4822
aS"He's too little. He'd die."
p4823
aS"I've decided to call him Norbert,"
p4824
aS"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mommy?"
p4825
ag11
aS"I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I can't."
p4826
aS"You're losing it, too,"
p4827
aS"I'm Ron, remember?"
p4828
aS'No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!'
p4829
aS'Brilliant!'
p4830
aS'How about it, Hagrid?'
p4831
aS'It bit me!'
p4832
aS"I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby."
p4833
aS"It's Hedwig!"
p4834
aS"She'll have Charlie's answer!"
p4835
aS"We've got the invisibility cloak,"
p4836
aS"It shouldn't be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert."
p4837
aS"It's not just my hand,"
p4838
aS"although that feels like it's\n"
p4839
ag11
aS'Midnight on Saturday!'
p4840
aS"Oh no oh no -- I've just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert."
p4841
aS"I won't let you in,"
p4842
aS"Norbert's at a tricky stage -- nothin' I can't handle."
p4843
aS"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only a baby, after all."
p4844
aS"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,"
p4845
aS"An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely."
p4846
aS'Detention!'
p4847
aS'And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --'
p4848
aS"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a dragon!"
p4849
aS'What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!'
p4850
aS'Well, well, well,'
p4851
aS'we are in trouble.'
p4852
aS'Harry!'
p4853
aS'I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag --'
p4854
aS"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain yourselves."
p4855
aS"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on,"
p4856
aS"It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?"
p4857
aS"I'm disgusted,"
p4858
aS"Four students out of bed in one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor."
p4859
aS'Fifty points each,'
p4860
aS'Professor -- please '
p4861
ag11
aS"Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students."
p4862
aS'Thanks Potter, we owe you one!'
p4863
aS"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like\n"
p4864
ag11
aS'Resign?'
p4865
aS"What good'll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?"
p4866
aS'No -- no -- not again, please --'
p4867
aS"Snape's done it, then!"
p4868
aS"If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell --"
p4869
aS"There's still Fluffy, though,"
p4870
aS"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,"
p4871
aS"I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?"
p4872
aS"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure."
p4873
aS"But we've got no proof!"
p4874
aS"Quirrell's too scared to back us up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the\n"
p4875
ag11
aS'If we just do a bit of poking around --'
p4876
aS'Follow me,'
p4877
aS' he said, leering at them. '
p4878
ag11
aS'Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.'
p4879
aS"I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece."
p4880
aS'The forest?'
p4881
aS"We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there\n"
p4882
ag11
aS"That's your problem, isn't it?"
p4883
aS"Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn't you?"
p4884
aS"Abou' time,"
p4885
aS"I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?"
p4886
aS"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid,"
p4887
ag11
aS"That's why yer late, is it?"
p4888
aS"Bin lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit, I'll take over from here."
p4889
aS"I'll be back at dawn,"
p4890
aS"for what's left of them,"
p4891
aS"I'm not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.\n"
p4892
aS'Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,'
p4893
aS"Yeh've done wrong an' now yehve got ter pay fer it."
p4894
aS"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd\n"
p4895
aS' Hagrid growled. '
p4896
aS"'\n"
p4897
aS'Right then,'
p4898
aS"now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here a moment."
p4899
aS'Look there,'
p4900
aS"see that stuff shinin' on the ground?\n"
p4901
ag11
aS'And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?'
p4902
aS"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,"
p4903
aS"An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least."
p4904
aS'I want Fang,'
p4905
aS"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward,"
p4906
aS" So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be careful -- let's go."
p4907
aS'Not fast enough,'
p4908
aS"It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before."
p4909
aS'You all right, Hermione?'
p4910
aS"Don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE!"
p4911
aS"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,"
p4912
aS'Right, follow me, but careful, now.'
p4913
aS"Who's there?"
p4914
aS"Show yerself -- I'm armed!"
p4915
aS"Oh, it's you, Ronan,"
p4916
aS'How are yeh?'
p4917
aS'Good evening to you, Hagrid,'
p4918
aS'Were you going to shoot me?'
p4919
aS"Can't be too careful, Ronan,"
p4920
aS"There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.))\n"
p4921
aS"We'd noticed,"
p4922
aS'Good evening,'
p4923
aS'Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?'
p4924
aS'Erm --'
p4925
aS'A bit,'
p4926
aS"A bit. Well, that's something."
p4927
aS'Mars is bright tonight.'
p4928
aS'Yeah,'
p4929
aS"Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?"
p4930
aS'Always the innocent are the first victims,'
p4931
aS'So it has been for ages past, so it is now.'
p4932
aS'Yeah,'
p4933
aS"but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Anythin' unusual?"
p4934
aS'Mars is bright tonight,'
p4935
aS'Unusually bright.'
p4936
aS"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. "
p4937
ag11
aS'The forest hides many secrets.'
p4938
aS'Hullo, Bane,'
p4939
aS'All right?'
p4940
aS'Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?'
p4941
aS"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin' about it?"
p4942
aS'Mars is bright tonight,'
p4943
aS"We've heard,"
p4944
aS"Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then."
p4945
aS'Never,'
p4946
aS"try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon."
p4947
aS'Are there many of them in here?'
p4948
aS"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind, centaurs... they know things... jus' don' let on much."
p4949
aS"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?"
p4950
aS"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns -- never heard anythin' like it before."
p4951
aS'Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!'
p4952
aS'You two wait here!'
p4953
aS"Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!"
p4954
aS"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?"
p4955
aS"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our fault he's here in the first place."
p4956
aS"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'. Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry,"
p4957
aS"but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done."
p4958
aS'Look --'
p4959
aS'AAAAAAAAAARGH!'
p4960
aS'You are the Potter boy,'
p4961
aS'You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.\n'
p4962
aS'Firenze!'
p4963
aS'What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?'
p4964
aS'Do you realize who this is?'
p4965
aS'This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.'
p4966
aS'What have you been telling him?'
p4967
aS'Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read\n'
p4968
ag11
aS"I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, "
p4969
aS'For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!'
p4970
aS'Do you not see that unicorn?'
p4971
aS'Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.'
p4972
aS"Why's Bane so angry?"
p4973
aS'What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?'
p4974
aS'Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?'
p4975
aS'No,'
p4976
aS"We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions."
p4977
aS'That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,'
p4978
aS'Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.'
p4979
aS"But who'd be that desperate?"
p4980
aS"If you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?"
p4981
aS'It is,'
p4982
aS'unless all you need is to stay alive long\n'
p4983
ag11
aS"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't understand who --"
p4984
aS'Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?'
p4985
aS'Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.'
p4986
aS'Harry! Harry, are you all right?'
p4987
aS"I'm fine,"
p4988
aS"The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there."
p4989
aS'This is where I leave you,'
p4990
aS'You are safe now.'
p4991
aS'Good luck, Harry Potter,'
p4992
aS'The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.'
p4993
aS"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get\n"
p4994
ag11
aS"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so.... Bane was furious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.... They must show that Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that's written\n"
p4995
ag11
aS"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,"
p4996
aS"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy."
p4997
aS"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,\n"
p4998
ag11
aS'That was far easier than I thought it would be,'
p4999
aS"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager."
p5000
aS'I wish I knew what this means!'
p5001
aS"My scar keeps hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this."
p5002
aS'Go to Madam Pomfrey,'
p5003
aS"I'm not ill,"
p5004
aS"I think it's a warning... it means danger's coming...."
p5005
aS"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as\n"
p5006
ag11
aS"I've just thought of something,"
p5007
aS"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now."
p5008
aS'Why?'
p5009
aS"Don't you think it's a bit odd,"
p5010
aS"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?"
p5011
aS'What are you talking about?'
p5012
aS"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know\n"
p5013
ag11
aS'Dunno,'
p5014
aS"he wouldn' take his cloak off."
p5015
aS"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head -- that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up."
p5016
aS'Mighta come up,'
p5017
aS"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here.... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told\n"
p5018
ag11
aS"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off\n"
p5019
ag11
aS"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!"
p5020
aS"Forget I said it! Hey -- where're yeh goin'?"
p5021
aS"We've got to go to Dumbledore,"
p5022
aS'Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that\n'
p5023
ag11
aS'What are you three doing inside?'
p5024
aS'See Professor Dumbledore?'
p5025
aS'Why?'
p5026
aS"It's sort of secret,"
p5027
aS'Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,'
p5028
aS'He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.'
p5029
aS'Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time --\n'
p5030
aS'But this is important.'
p5031
aS'Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter.\n'
p5032
aS'Look,'
p5033
aS"Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone --"
p5034
aS'How do you know --?'
p5035
aS"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone's going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore."
p5036
aS'Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,'
p5037
ag11
aS'But Professor --'
p5038
aS"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,"
p5039
ag11
aS"It's tonight,"
p5040
aS"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up."
p5041
aS'But what can we --'
p5042
aS'Good afternoon,'
p5043
aS"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,"
p5044
ag11
aS'Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.'
p5045
aS"Right, here's what we've got to do,"
p5046
aS"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that."
p5047
aS'Why me?'
p5048
aS"It's obvious,"
p5049
aS'You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.'
p5050
aS"'Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'"
p5051
aS'Oh, shut up,'
p5052
aS"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of\n"
p5053
aS' she stormed. '
p5054
aS' Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, '
p5055
aS' when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came\n'
p5056
aS"I'm sorry, Harry!"
p5057
aS'Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him,\n'
p5058
ag11
aS"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first."
p5059
aS"You're mad!"
p5060
aS"You can't!"
p5061
aS"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You'll be expelled!"
p5062
ag11
aS"You're right Harry,"
p5063
aS"I'll use the invisibility cloak,"
p5064
aS"It's just lucky I got it back."
p5065
aS'But will it cover all three of us?'
p5066
aS'All -- all three of us?'
p5067
aS"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?"
p5068
aS'Of course not,'
p5069
aS"How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful..."
p5070
aS'But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.'
p5071
aS'Not if I can help it,'
p5072
aS"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me out after that."
p5073
aS"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --"
p5074
aS'What are you doing?'
p5075
aS'Nothing, Neville, nothing,'
p5076
aS"You're going out again,"
p5077
aS'No, no, no,'
p5078
aS"No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?"
p5079
aS"You can't go out,"
p5080
aS"you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble."
p5081
aS"You don't understand,"
p5082
aS'this is important.'
p5083
aS' he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. '
p5084
ag11
aS"Don't you call me an idiot!"
p5085
ag11
aS'Go on then, try and hit me!'
p5086
aS"I'm ready!"
p5087
aS'Do something,'
p5088
aS'Neville,'
p5089
aS"I'm really, really sorry about this."
p5090
aS'Petrificus Totalus!'
p5091
aS"It's the full Body-Bind,"
p5092
aS"Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry."
p5093
aS'We had to, Neville, no time to explain,'
p5094
aS"Who's there?"
p5095
aS"Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?"
p5096
aS"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen."
p5097
aS'Peeves,'
p5098
aS'the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.'
p5099
aS'So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,'
p5100
aS"My mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir."
p5101
aS'I have business here, Peeves,'
p5102
aS'Stay away from this place tonight.'
p5103
aS'I will, sir, I most certainly will,'
p5104
aS"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you."
p5105
aS'Brilliant, Harry!'
p5106
aS"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,"
p5107
aS"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now."
p5108
aS"What's that at its feet?"
p5109
aS'Looks like a harp,'
p5110
aS'Snape must have left it there.'
p5111
aS'It must wake up the moment you stop playing,'
p5112
aS'Well, here goes...'
p5113
aS"No, I don't!"
p5114
aS'What can you see?'
p5115
aS"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop."
p5116
aS'You want to go first? Are you sure?'
p5117
aS"I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep."
p5118
aS'Right,'
p5119
aS'See you in a minute, I hope...\n'
p5120
aS"It's okay!"
p5121
aS"it's a soft landing, you can jump!"
p5122
aS"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!"
p5123
aS'We must be miles under the school , she said. '
p5124
aS' said Ron. '
p5125
aS' shrieked Hermione. '
p5126
ag11
aS'Stop moving!'
p5127
aS"I know what this is -- it's Devil's Snare!"
p5128
aS"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,"
p5129
aS"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!"
p5130
aS"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp\n"
p5131
aS"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!"
p5132
aS'Oh, right!'
p5133
aS'Yeah,'
p5134
aS"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis -- 'there's no wood,' honestly."
p5135
aS'This way,'
p5136
aS"Do you think it's a ghost?"
p5137
aS"I don't know... sounds like wings to me."
p5138
aS"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving."
p5139
aS"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?"
p5140
aS'Probably,'
p5141
aS"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll run."
p5142
aS'Now what?'
p5143
aS"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration,"
p5144
aS"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle."
p5145
aS'That one!'
p5146
aS'That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.'
p5147
aS"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!"
p5148
aS"It's obvious, isn't it?"
p5149
aS"We've got to play our way across the room."
p5150
aS'How?'
p5151
aS'I think,'
p5152
aS"we're going to have to be chessmen."
p5153
aS"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces...."
p5154
aS'Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle.'
p5155
aS'What about you?'
p5156
aS"I'm going to be a knight,"
p5157
aS'White always plays first in chess,'
p5158
aS'Yes... look...'
p5159
aS'Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.'
p5160
aS'Had to let that happen,'
p5161
aS'Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.'
p5162
aS"We're nearly there,"
p5163
aS'Let me think let me think...'
p5164
aS"That's chess!"
p5165
aS"You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!"
p5166
aS'But --'
p5167
aS'Do you want to stop Snape or not?'
p5168
aS'Ron --'
p5169
aS"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!"
p5170
ag11
aS"What if he's --?"
p5171
aS"He'll be all right,"
p5172
aS"What do you reckon's next?"
p5173
aS"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's."
p5174
aS"Snape's,"
p5175
aS'What do we have to do?'
p5176
aS'Brilliant,'
p5177
aS"This isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever."
p5178
aS"But so will we, won't we?"
p5179
aS'Of course not,'
p5180
aS'Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.'
p5181
aS'But how do we know which to drink?'
p5182
aS'Give me a minute.'
p5183
aS'Got it,'
p5184
aS'The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone.'
p5185
aS"There's only enough there for one of us,"
p5186
aS"That's hardly one swallow."
p5187
aS'Which one will get you back through the purple flames?'
p5188
aS'You drink that,'
p5189
aS"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really."
p5190
aS"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?"
p5191
aS"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?"
p5192
aS'I might get lucky again.'
p5193
aS'Hermione!'
p5194
aS"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know."
p5195
aS"I'm not as good as you,"
p5196
aS'Me!'
p5197
aS'Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!'
p5198
aS'You drink first,'
p5199
aS"You are sure which is which, aren't you?"
p5200
aS'Positive,'
p5201
aS'Quick, go, before it wears off.'
p5202
aS'Good luck -- take care.'
p5203
aS'Here I come,'
p5204
aS'You!'
p5205
aS'Me,'
p5206
aS"I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter."
p5207
aS'But I thought -- Snape --'
p5208
aS'Severus?'
p5209
aS"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't\n"
p5210
ag11
aS"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."
p5211
aS'Snape was trying to save me?'
p5212
aS'Of course,'
p5213
aS"\\Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it\n"
p5214
ag11
aS"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone."
p5215
aS'You let the troll in?'
p5216
aS"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.\n"
p5217
aS'Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\n'
p5218
aS'This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,'
p5219
aS"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the\n"
p5220
ag11
aS'I saw you and Snape in the forest --'
p5221
aS'Yes,'
p5222
aS"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...."
p5223
aS'But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.'
p5224
aS'Oh, he does,'
p5225
aS"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead."
p5226
aS'But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you....'
p5227
aS'Sometimes,'
p5228
aS"I find it hard to follow my master's instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --"
p5229
aS'He is with me wherever I go,'
p5230
aS'I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of\n'
p5231
aS' Quirrell shivered suddenly. '
p5232
ag11
aS"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?"
p5233
aS'What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!'
p5234
aS'Use the boy... Use the boy...'
p5235
aS'Yes -- Potter -- come here.'
p5236
aS'Come here,'
p5237
aS'Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.'
p5238
aS'I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,'
p5239
aS"I -- I've won the house cup for Gryffindor."
p5240
aS'He lies... He lies...'
p5241
aS'Potter, come back here!'
p5242
aS'Tell me the truth! What did you just see?'
p5243
aS'Let me speak to him... face-to-face...'
p5244
aS'Master, you are not strong enough!'
p5245
aS'I have strength enough... for this....'
p5246
aS'Harry Potter...'
p5247
aS'See what I have become?'
p5248
aS"Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life,\n"
p5249
ag11
aS"Don't be a fool,"
p5250
aS"Better save your own life and join me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging me for mercy..."
p5251
aS'How touching...'
p5252
aS"I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain."
p5253
aS'Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!'
p5254
aS'Then kill him, fool, and be done!'
p5255
aS'KILL HIM! KILL HIM!'
p5256
aS'Harry! Harry!'
p5257
aS'Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,'
p5258
aS'Quirrell does not have the Stone.'
p5259
aS'Then who does? Sir, I --'
p5260
aS'Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\n'
p5261
aS'Tokens from your friends and admirers,'
p5262
aS'What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to\n'
p5263
ag11
aS'How long have I been in here?'
p5264
aS'Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.'
p5265
aS'But sit, the Stone\n'
p5266
aS"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?"
p5267
aS'We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just\n'
p5268
ag11
aS'It was you.'
p5269
aS'I feared I might be too late.'
p5270
aS"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer --"
p5271
aS'Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.'
p5272
aS'Oh, you know about Nicolas?'
p5273
aS"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had\n"
p5274
ag11
aS"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?"
p5275
aS'They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.'
p5276
aS"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas\n"
p5277
aS' Harry lay\n'
p5278
aS'Sir?'
p5279
aS"I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --"
p5280
aS'Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.'
p5281
aS"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?"
p5282
aS'No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.\n'
p5283
ag11
aS'The truth.'
p5284
aS"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie."
p5285
aS'Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?'
p5286
aS'Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know.'
p5287
aS"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,\n"
p5288
ag11
aS'Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.'
p5289
aS'Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.'
p5290
aS"And there's something else..."
p5291
aS'Fire away.'
p5292
aS'Quirrell said Snape --'
p5293
aS'Professor Snape, Harry.'
p5294
aS'Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?'
p5295
aS'Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.'
p5296
aS'What?'
p5297
aS'He saved his life.'
p5298
aS'What?'
p5299
aS'Yes...'
p5300
aS"Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt....\n"
p5301
ag11
aS"And sir, there's one more thing..."
p5302
aS'Just the one?'
p5303
aS'How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?'
p5304
aS"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be\n"
p5305
ag11
aS'Alas! Ear wax!'
p5306
aS'Absolutely not.'
p5307
aS'You let Professor Dumbledore in...'
p5308
aS'Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.'
p5309
aS'I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey...'
p5310
aS'Oh, very well,'
p5311
aS'But five minutes only.'
p5312
aS'Harry!'
p5313
aS'Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried --'
p5314
aS"The whole school's talking about it,"
p5315
aS'What really happened?'
p5316
aS"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\n"
p5317
aS'I always said he was off his rocker,'
p5318
aS'So what happened to you two?'
p5319
aS'Well, I got back all right,'
p5320
aS'I brought Ron round --\n'
p5321
ag11
aS"D'you think he meant you to do it?"
p5322
aS"Sending you your father's cloak and everything?"
p5323
aS'Well, '
p5324
aS"if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible -- you could have been killed."
p5325
ag11
aS"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food'll be good."
p5326
aS"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT"
p5327
aS" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can't I?"
p5328
aS'Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,'
p5329
aS'And you have another visitor.'
p5330
aS'Oh, good,'
p5331
aS'Who is it?'
p5332
aS"It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!"
p5333
ag11
aS'Hagrid!'
p5334
aS"Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him."
p5335
aS"Yeh could've died!"
p5336
aS"An' don' say the name!"
p5337
aS"That reminds me. I've got yeh a present."
p5338
aS"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?"
p5339
aS'Another year gone!'
p5340
aS"And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get\n"
p5341
aS'Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.'
p5342

p5346
aS'First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...'
p5347
aS'...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.'

aS'Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the\n'
p5350

aS'There are all kinds of courage,'
p5351
aS'It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.'
p5352
aS'Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, '

p5369
aS"You must be Harry's family!"
p5370
aS'In a manner of speaking,'
p5371

aS'I want to ask you something.'
p5387

ag5391

aS"Oh, I wouldn't read that if I were you,"
p5427

aS'No,'

aS'Fine,'
p5457
aS'All right, you three?'

aS'Potter! Granger! I want to see you both!'

p5460

p5468
aS'I see,'
p5469
aS'Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues --'
p5470
aS'Shut up, Malfoy,'
p5471
ag5471
aS'Shut up, Malfoy,'
p5472
aS"Tha's it,"
p5473
aS"Tha's it, Harry... now, bow."
p5474
aS'This is very easy,'
p5475
aS"There's a light on in Hagrid's window,"
p5476
aS"He's faking it, "
p5477
aS"Madam Pomfrey can mend anything. She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it's worth."
p5478
aS"At, maybe she's right,"
p5479
aS"What's he done?"
p5480
aS'Yeah,'
p5481
ag66
aS"Potter, you can skin Malfoy's shrivelfig,"
p5482
ag69
aS"Yeah, that's right,"
p5483
aS'What are you talking about?'
p5484
aS"You should have finished adding your ingredients by now; this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while it simmers and then we'll test Longbottom's... "
p5485
ag72
ag73

ag80
aS'And me,'

aS'Yes, Potter?'

ag95
ag96
aS"There's always the feast,"
p5490
aS'You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.'
p5491
aS'Yeah,'
p5492
aS'great.'
p5493
aS'Password?'
p5494
aS'Fortuna Major,'
p5495
aS'What are you doing?'
p5496
aS'Nothing,'
p5497
aS'Well, get back to your common room where you belong!'
p5498
aS'Harry?'
p5499
aS'Ah,'
p5500
aS"Why don't you come in? I've just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson."
p5501
aS'A\n'
p5502
aS'All right,'
p5503
aS'How did you know about that?'
p5504
ag5504
aS'Professor McGonagall told me,'
p5505
aS"You're not worried, are you?"
p5506
aS'No,'
p5507
aS'Yes,'
p5508
aS'You know that day we fought the boggart?'
p5509
aS"Why didn't you let me fight it?"
p5510
aS"I didn't think of Voldemort,"
p5511
aS'I -- I remembered those dementors.'
p5512
aS'Not at all,'
p5513
aS'Why --?'
p5514
aS'Some people reckon --'
p5515
aS"some people reckon he'd do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job."
p5516
aS'Yeah, maybe,'
p5517
ag98
aS"Honestly, am I the only person who's ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A History?"
p5518
aS'Headmaster?'
p5519
aS"The whole of the third floor has been searched. He's not there. And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either."
p5520
aS'Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?'
p5521
aS'Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.'
p5522
aS"I know he's after me,"
p5523
aS"I heard Ron's dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic."
p5524
aS"I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you'll understand why I don't think it's a good idea for you to be practicing\n"
p5525
aS"There's nothing wrong with Malfoy's arm!"
p5526
aS"He's faking it!"
p5527
aS"Diggory's got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him --"
p5528
aS"What's wrong with him?"
p5529
aS"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,"
p5530
aS"Why's he got it in for Lupin? D'you think this is all because of the boggart?"
p5531
aS'What did you do that for?'
p5532
aS'You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,'
p5533
aS'There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and chase them. Go on,'
p5534
aS'Leave Scabbers alone.'
p5535
aS'Stand and fight, you mangy cur!'
p5536
aS'Oh, shut up,'
p5537
aS'Mount Your brooms.,, He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a\n'
p5538
aS"I've got no chance with these on,"
p5539
aS"We didn't -- lose?"
p5540
aS'Did you hear about the dementors too?'
p5541
aS'When they get near me --'
p5542
aS'I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.'
p5543
aS'Why did they have to come to the match?'
p5544
aS'Azkaban must be terrible,'
p5545
aS'But Sirius Black escaped from them,'
p5546
aS'He got away...'
p5547
aS'You made that dementor on the train back off,'
p5548
aS'What defenses?'
p5549
aS'Can you teach me?'
p5550
aS'What are you doing?'
p5551
aS"How come you're not going to Hogsmeade?"
p5552
aS'A bit of old parchment!'
p5553
aS'Explain, George.'
p5554
aS'Dissendium.'
p5555
ag5555
aS'Dissendium!'
p5556
aS"He can't be getting in through a passage,"
p5557
aS"There are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them. And of the other three -- one of them's caved in, so no one can get through it. one of them's got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can't get out of it. And the one I just came through -well - - it's really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there..."
p5558
aS'Are you going to report me?'
p5559
aS'Oh -- of course not -- but honestly, Harry --'
p5560
aS"What else, m'dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what\n"
p5561
aS'It has happened, My Lord...\n'
p5562
aS"Gone! It's the first day of the holidays, remember?"
p5563
aS"It's nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute."
p5564
aS"I'll never know what they'd have wanted, because thanks to Black, I've never spoken to them,"
p5565
aS"No, let's visit Hagrid,"
p5566
aS"Well, that's okay then, Hagrid!"
p5567
ag119
ag124
ag125
ag130
ag131
aS"He's not looking too good, is he?"
p5568
aS"I'm working on it,"
p5569
aS"Professor Lupin said he'd train me to ward off the dementors. We should be starting this week. He said he'd have time after Christmas."
p5570
aS"Don't get excited, Oliver,"
p5571
aS"I haven't got it anymore. It was confiscated."
p5572
aS'Sirius Black'
p5573
aS"He's supposed to be after me. So McGonagall reckons he might have sent it."
p5574
aS'Ah yes,'
p5575
aS"Let me see... how about eight o'clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough.... I'll have to think carefully about how we're going to do this.... We can't bring a\n"
p5576
aS'So...'
p5577
aS'The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond ordinary Wizarding Level. It is called the Patronus Charm.'
p5578
aS'How does it work?'
p5579
aS"The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it."
p5580
aS'What does a Patronus look like?'
p5581
aS'Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.'
p5582
aS'And how do you conjure it?'
p5583
aS'Expecto patronum, '
p5584
aS'expecto patronum.'
p5585
aS'Did you see that?'
p5586
aS'Something happened!'
p5587
aS'Yes,'
p5588
aS'Expecto patronum!'
p5589
aS'Expecto patronum! Expecto --'
p5590
aS"Not Harry! Not Harry! please -- I'll\n"
p5591
aS'Yes...'
p5592
aS"It's getting worse,"
p5593
aS'I could hear her louder that time -- and him -- Voldemort\n'
p5594
aS'I do!'
p5595
aS'Go!'
p5596
aS'Expecto patronum!'
p5597
aS'Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --'
p5598
aS'I heard my dad,'
p5599
aS"That's the first time I've ever heard him -- he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it...."
p5600
aS'Yeah...'
p5601
aS"Why -- you didn't know my dad, did you?"
p5602
aS'Excellent!'
p5603
aS'Excellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!'
p5604
ag134
ag134
ag134
aS"I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,"
p5605
aS'Oh -Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,'

p5607
aS'Yes,'
p5608

aS'And...'
p5810
aS"I am no longer your teacher, so I don't feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It's no use to me, and I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it."

aS'Good-bye, then, Remus,'

aS"It didn't make any difference,"

aS'Pettigrew got away.'

aS"Yes... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said ... she said Voldemort's servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight.... She said the servant would help him come back to power."
p5815
